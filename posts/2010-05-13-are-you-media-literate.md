The semester is ending (I'm excited about this), and that means that I have lots of homework and lots of projects -- or at least I did, this past week. My favorite course this semester has been Media Literacy, and the final for this was a project to give an overview of what media literacy is. I decided to stick with my skills (as well as pick up a few new techniques) and create an interactive web piece.

It was fun! I'd love to hear what you think of it. You'll need a modern browser (Safari, Firefox 3+, or Chrome) and I'd suggest a normal screen resolution with a minimum of 1024px wide.
