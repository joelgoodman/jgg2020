We're kind of feeling it here. The erratic weather--sunshine and warm to rain and chilly--and plenty green popping up. The flowers are looking nice and the air smells sweet--AND it's light jacket weather, which I like. And since we're staying here another year, Jess and I are going to start gardening soon. It should be a good summer.
