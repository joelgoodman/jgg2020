Once again, I absolutely **love** last.fm. I've decided to look at what albums I listened to the most this past year and--I know the year isn't officially finished, but it's close enough--to post the top ten. I suppose in a way this is defining my 2008 in album terms.

It's an interesting look over all, actually. So here is a portion of my charts. To see the entire thing click [here](http://www.last.fm/user/asilentthing/charts?subtype=albums). Discuss what this means amongst yourself. Or in the comments.

1. The Good, The Bad & The Queen – The Good, The Bad & The Queen
2. Norah Jones – Not Too Late
3. Vampire Weekend – Vampire Weekend
4. Oasis – Stop The Clocks
5. Bloc Party – A Weekend In the City
6. The Stone Roses – The Stone Roses
7. Arctic Monkeys – Favourite Worst Nightmare
8. Ryan Adams – Gold
9. The Wallflowers – Bringing Down the Horse
10. The Killers – Sam's Town
