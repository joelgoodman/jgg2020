We made it to Portland. Left Apple Valley at around 2 PM yesterday and got here around 10 AM today. Drove all night. I've been up for about 30 hours.

Proof of how tired I am:

We are at my sister's apartment, just waiting until we can check into our hotel and get some sleep. And a hot shower.

It's been a looooooong two days.
