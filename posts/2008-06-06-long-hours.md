[![P is for Panda](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3006/2554419006_45e3232686.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/asilentthing/2554419006/)

Here's a picture of me wearing one of my new [P is for Panda](http://pisforpanda.bigcartel.com) shirts.

Our friend Micah and I went to Collinsville yesterday to pick up 26 boxes of laminate flooring for my house. It's all stacked up in the library. I know what my June project is.

It's also Alumni Reunion Weekend here at GC. That means I don't get a weekend. That also means I get a comp day that we're using to go to West Virginia in two weeks to visit Jessica's family.

Then two weekends after that, we fly to Porto, Portugal. That will be amazing. Then we go to Dublin and spend four days visiting historic sites, pubs, museums, shopping and taking LOADS of photos. I'm really looking forward to it. I need a break!

And one of my new online friends, [Harry](http://mynameisharry.tumblr.com/), is planning a trip to the US from his hometown of Yeovil (England). He is trying to work on heading this way. St Louis is a cool city, so we hope he can make it around August.

This weekend includes storms, videotaping, wind, rain, photography, old people, protestors against the removal of [Hogue Hall](http://hoguehall.greenville.edu), mediocre food, and heavy lifting. Yay me.
