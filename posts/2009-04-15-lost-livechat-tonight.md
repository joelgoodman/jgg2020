Yes friends. A group of us on good ol [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joelgoodman) livechat during LOST every week. Tonight's episode is rumoured be Miles-centric (which I'm excited about) and should be FAN-tastic.

We're loving the show this season. It's been so great. So many questions answered, so much action... just. Awesome.

So, this is a formal invitation, If you live in and Eastern or Central timezone (or equivalent--we had someone in Venezuela join us last week, and we have a chatter from the Great White North every once in a while), come chat with us a few minutes before show start.

I'll tweet out a link tonight, so if you're not following me on Twitter, you'd better start!

Hope to see you there tonight! It's gonna be awesome.
