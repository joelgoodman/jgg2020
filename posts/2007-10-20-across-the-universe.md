So. Incredible movie. Jessica and I saw it in Edwardsville today--I didn't even know they were playing it there. We were planning to drive out to Plaza Frontenac in St Louis is watch this bloody film. But we were able to see it nearby.

In any case. Beautiful, phenomenal film. To start with, the actors are incredible at both playing their parts believably and as well as vocally representing these Beatles tunes. The flow of the film was great as well. The songs fit so well into the story created.

Cinematography in this fill was... MINDBLOWING. From using really standard techniques like solarized film, to really crazy stuff with cutting out frames and timing wave crashes with other video overlay to music... Some of it was so crazy thatÂ  you're just in awe. My favorite was probably w/Bono singing *I Am the Walrus*.

The film during that act was insane. In any case, I am so glad we got to see it today. It was incredible.

I highly recommend this film. GO AND SEE IT. It's entirely worthwhile. One of the greatest movies experiences I have ever had. Even if you don't like The Beatles, you probably will after this film.
