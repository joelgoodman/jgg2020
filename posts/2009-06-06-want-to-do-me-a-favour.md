Um, so I need a vector drawing done for a new project.

If you're interested in having some fun doing a small logo-ish illustration and/or want to do me a favour, I'd appreciate it. I kind of suck at Illustrator (most of the time).

I hate having the idea in my head and not being able to put it on a digital canvas. But... yeah. Maybe I should just practice more.

I have a fun new site coming out soon I think... I'm a little excited about it.
