Things'll be a bit quiet around here this weekend.

At work, I am a staff advisor for a student-run music the school puts on each year, and this is that weekend. So I'm out making sure the students are thinking of everything, handling any emergencies, taking photos, filming stuff... pretty much everything.

One cool this is that I have some of the students twittering for us during the festival and then a bunch of that content is being pulled into the website, [agapefest.com](http://www.agapefest.com). It's been fun. You should check it out.

So anyway, I'll be occupied by that this weekend. Talk to you all on Sunday for sure.
