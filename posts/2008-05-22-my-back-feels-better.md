It took a few minutes, but the adjustment the chiropractor gave me today has helped. I don't think it hurts anymore at all. Well, maybe a little. But it's definitely less.

We're going to see Indiana Jones tonight with [André and Liz](http://andreandliz.com) and eating and Red Robin beforehand. I'm excited for all three.

Also. [New Mummy movie](http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/themummytombofthedragonemperor/large.html)?!? Didn't see that coming.
