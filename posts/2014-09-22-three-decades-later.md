Hi. I am 30 years old today. I made it through my twenties unscathed and pretty happy.

We held an epic Yacht Rock party with 55 of our friends out on *The Commodore*, a riverboat that cruises down Lake Austin and the lower Colorado River (no, not that Colorado River... the Texas one).

We ate BBQ, listened to some amazing smooth music, and watched the fancy houses go by. Jessica and I are so privileged to have great friends here in Austin and across the rest of the world. Their generosity and fun spirits make our lives better and they made my 30th birthday the best I've had.

A milestone year like this makes me feel as though I should set some goals.

We have a lot of things happening right now. First, we're going to be moving to a new rental house in Austin at the start of October. The neighborhood will be nicer and more conducive to getting outside and walking the dog, riding my bike, and cooking at home.
/postshttps://www.joelgoodman.co/hustle-is-hope/) idea I've been thinking through for so long. There's a lot more in the works, but I'm excited to work with [Keith Davis Young](https://dribbble.com/shots/1735504-Hustle-Is-Hope) on some amazing design and printed goods in preparation for the talk I'm giving at the [Aggregate Conference](https://aggregateconference.com) next weekend and (hopefully) a forthcoming book.

Last, work is going really well and I'm looking at ways to grow what [Bravery](https://bravery.co) is doing to other markets. We're sponsoring #GGRGT and I'd love to sponsor some more conferences next year if we can retain that marketing budget. There are some other schemes and plans in the works that I'll announce later on, but it's a pretty exciting time.

### So these goals

I've got a few things I want to get done this year. Here's my focused list:

1. Get my weight back down to 160 lbs.
*I've been losing weight off and on for the last year and a half and realized I need a more focused approach, specifically in the form of a daily routine. I've got this worked out, and am excited to put it into practice after we've moved.*
2. Become proficient on the banjo.
*Part of my new routine includes stopping work each evening at 5:30 to play an instrument.*
3. Draft the *Hustle is Hope* book.
*This should've been done a long time ago, but now that I'm speaking on it and have some design done, I'm more inclined to focus on writing the actual book.*

That's my focused list. By keeping the items number low, but the goals specific and not too simple, I'm more likely to stick to them.

A lot has happened in life over the past 30 years and I'm excited to see what else is coming down the pike.
