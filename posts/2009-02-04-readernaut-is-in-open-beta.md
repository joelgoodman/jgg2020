It's no secret that I love this awesome reading social network called [Readernaut](http://readernaut.com/joelgoodman). The site is awesome. it keeps track of your library, current reading progress, pages read, and shares that with friends who are also into reading.

Also super exciting is the fact that Readernaut is now out of private beta. That means anyone can sign up for a beta account and start helping make the site even more amazing than it is right now.

If you are at all a reader, go over to [readernaut.com](http://www.readernaut.com) and sign up for an account. Then follow me so we can share books recommendations and stuff.
