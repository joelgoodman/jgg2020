They jacked our DSL bill up. Didn't tell me. Just added $5 onto the price. That on top of me having to pay for a phone line we don't use. What else is interesting is that through all of the other price fluctuations they've had during the last year, our price has never been modified. But now. Apparently they thought it was fine to do this and not notify me.

The first CSR I got said the price increase was because of their new 24-hour tech support and antivirus software. And I don't use either of those. I was perfectly happy with the service I had before without...

Shoot. Stupid cell interference. Only when I connect with them. I hate this.
