![NaNoWriMo Winner!](http://joelgoodman.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nano_08_winner_large1.gif)I won. I got to 50k words! I'm still not done with the story, but it shouldn't be too much longer.

Thanks to everyone who's been cheering me on and/or reading the story. It's been super helpful having that accountability to keep writing. And I've done it! I've written a novel.

I'm excited to do this again next year too. What a great program.

I would also encourage all of you to join in next year. Check out NaNoWriMo's website by clicking [here](http://www.nanowrimo.org).
