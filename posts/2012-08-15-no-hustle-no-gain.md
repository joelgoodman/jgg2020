The end of July/first half of this month has been crazy hectic for me. Austin is truly the land of opportunity for someone like me – I picked up three new clients right away after starting work at [Capital Factory](http://www.capitalfactory.com). It's great to be able to help out some of the young startups here while still making a little bit of money. What's not fun is promising all of your time away.

I think this past week I work 12-15 hours a day, 5 or 6 days in a row. It all blurs together a bit, so I'm not entirely sure. The fruit of that: today TIU launched its new undergraduate site. This is kind of my last hurrah for them (and higher ed, unless I decide to go back at some point). I had the concept earlier this year and designed the aesthetic components in April. And today it's alive.

Last week we launched MyTIU - something I had been working on for them. So... two projects down and I feel like I've nearly tied up all the loose ends I left at TIU back in June.

Otherwise I've been working for a tennis startup that's about to start their Betaspring stint; Volume11 stuff, of course – actually most of my week is for v11; [Dept. 3](http://dept3.com) work; a company called [GetPromotd](http://getpromotd.com) hired me to do some design work for them. All around, a diverse range of things to do.
