Wow. What a crazy week. We had an absolutely fantastic time in Portugal and Dublin. We traveled by plane, train and automobile. We saw ocean and hills and plains. We were in countries where we didn't know the native language and others where we just had to fight through accents. Days seemed like weeks and now the last week seems so short. We made new friends, some foreign some American. And now we've slept (though not as much as I had hoped), and I've gotten through some photos and they're uploading. Now I'll try and update.

We left early Thursday morning and took the Metrolink from Fairview Heights to STL. Then we flew 8 or so hours to Chicago, then Madrid and finally landed in Porto at 8:30 the following morning. That was a lot of flying. Especially on uncomfortable American Airlines seats.

When we first landed in Madrid's ultra-modern airport, I automatically felt the vibe of another, specifically non-English speaking country and culture. The next hour and a half I worried about Porto. We had to rent a car from Avis. And it would be a manual transmission.

I had only driven a manual transmission once in about a decade; the week prior to our leaving, Micah gave me a refresher. It went okay, but I didn't feel confident enough to drive a stick shift in a country I had never been in, where they spoke a language of which I know only six words (and of those six words, none of them useful - I mean, I can say "plate", "little boy", "little girl"... that sort of thing).

Sure enough, we get all the Avis stuff squared away and I had a huge struggle just getting out of the parking lot. And then, when we got to Esmoriz about a half hour later... I can't even remember how many times I stalled out. It's embarrassing.

Then we got lost. Luckily, I found a store that was also a Vodafone dealer. I managed to get a SIM card for the GSM phone I got from Jared and unlocked the night prior to us leaving. And that meant I could call André. Turns out, we had driven a couple houses past where we were staying. So we made our way back and were met outside by [Jon](http://claphammedia.com) and Brian (our new friend).

Thank God for Brian. He ended up driving our little stick shift Yaris all over so that I didn't have to. He is a great man.

So, we dumped our bags in our room at Centro Biblica de Esmoriz and were taken out to the small village of Esmoriz's main drag. The area was great. Just a bunch of shops and restaurants next to ocean. Jess and I were dead tired. But we went along with it and ended up stopping at a pizza place with everyone. We ate salad. Mine was mozzarella and tomato.

Something really interesting about Portugal is the amount of ice cream consumed. Maybe not consumed... I'm not going to look up the numbers right now. I mean how available it is. On every corner, in every restaurant, across the street, next door... everywhere. It's whatever the Good Humor brand is over there (I think it's Good Humor... the one that has the heart logo)... I think Olé or something like that. Crazy.

So, at lunch, Brian kind of filled us in on what activities we had missed. Karl, Lacey and Jon were with us too. We were the Centro Biblica de Esmoriz crew. Anyway. We ate, and went back. Even though it was like, 1:00 in the afternoon, it felt like 8:00 or 9:00pm.

André called me on our walk back to the center and invited us to the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner. So when we got back we crashed for a couple of hours and woke up just before it was time to go. Brian drove our car, following André, to Casa das Ribas and the amazing castle that it sits in the shadow of. We were super early for the rehearsal, so we each paid €3.00 or so and explored the castle. It was fantastic. I wish I had had my camera with me. But Jon got some great photos.

About an hour later Liz and the rest of the party arrived and we sat through the rehearsal. Jess and I sat back with Brian and Lacey and chatted. When they had gone through the program twice, we set off for the dinner. Which was amazing. So many good foods.

We ate and chatted over native drinks and foods, just having a great time. It was really fun. Then as more of André's friends arrived we got ready to go to his bachelor party. Which is another story. One that I obviously can't talk about here on a public blog. But if you're a guy and you want to hear about it, come talk to me. It was definitely a fun time.

That is day one. I think I'd probably better break this up into a few parts. So stay tuned for Day Two: The Wedding.
