Today is the three year anniversary of me being married to my lovely wife, [Jessica](https://waysideviolet.com).

In less than one hour we will be driving out to St Louis to the St Louis Art Museum, where we may take a look at the Jackson Pollack exhibit and take a few photos.

Then, we are planning on eating a delicious dinner at a gastropub we found downtown. I'm already hungry thinking about it.
