Man, this past week might have been the roughest I've ever experience. It was for sure the roughest in my young working career.

Suffice it to say that all institutes of higher education are hurting financially due to light wallets and expensive tuitions. And many of those schools are having to take drastic measures to stay afloat. And it finally hit my small school in the Midwest. And particularly the office I was working for.

No, I didn't lose my job. But I have been moved to a different department and am working for different bosses now. And it's certainly a welcome change. The move to IT actually relieves a lot of stress that I think has been building up for the past three weeks since we found out the VP over our department was heading to a different job at a different school. I take uncertainty hard. But this shaky ground solidified fairly quickly and I now know what I'm doing and who I am working for.

There's a lot of change going on in my workplace, but I'm glad I am now apart of a supportive office working with some of the smartest people I've ever known. Even better is that I've known many of them for a long time. It's good to be back in IT.
