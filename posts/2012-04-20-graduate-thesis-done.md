Sunday night I finished my graduate thesis for the Master of Arts in Media Studies at The New School. Yesterday I received the final signature I needed from my second reviewer. Today I left it in the capable (I hope) hands of FedEx, expecting it to arrive at the thesis office by Monday morning.

Feels good to be done. I'm making plans for some work I want to do for myself. But I wanted to take a minute and note that the faculty and program were wonderful. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time in classes. The administration side could use some work.

Since I've gotten this a few times, The New School *is* a real school. It is not a for-profit. In fact, The New School was founded in 1919 in New York City and offered refuge to German scholars fleeing Nazi persecution in the 1930s during the war. Since then, The New School has continued to expand its divisions, program offerings, and research subjects. It has a world-renowned design school, Parsons The New School for Design, as well as highly regarded divisions for Social Research, Jazz and Contemporary Music, Drama, and Public Engagement (my division).
