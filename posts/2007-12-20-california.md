we made it. it was a long drive, but we got in Sunday night. it's been a great vacation so far. Really nice to be with the family and hang out and buy Christmas presents.

Cors is doing well too. After my parents' dogs were groomed, we all became a happy family. Cors has been playing with Linus a lot. he doesn't really like Lucy at all.

Anyway. Five days till Christmas!
