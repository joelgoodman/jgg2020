I am considering rebranding myself... again.

Yes, this site did just go through a redesign a few months ago. I'm still happy with it, but I've had this idea bouncing around in my head for the last 14 months and I finally got around to playing with it... and I really like it.

But the cost of doing a new personal rebrand would be time. I'd need a new site design and probably need to order new [MOO cards](http://moo.com), not to mention redo my CV, résumé and invoice letterhead... The idea is so cool though.

How important is consistency in personal branding? Maybe consistency isn't what I mean. More like... how often can someone revise their brand? I don't think I have much equity in my own personal brand, and this next version would have some sticking power. I think.

Any thoughts on personal rebranding? Is it too soon for me? Should I just do it anyway?
