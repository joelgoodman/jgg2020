When my mom shipped presents to Jessica for her birthday she also included some of my old items left at my childhood home. The prize in that envelope was my [Diamond Rio PMP300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_PMP300). One of the earliest MP3 players ever on the market and definitely the first in the US to gain ground in sales.

When I first got it it was awesome. Pretty large, but really great. Then one day it just stopped working. I always thought it was something with the battery bay because it just stopped powering up. It was pretty sad. Given, it only held about ten songs on its 32MB. But after it broke I moved on to a [TDK Mojo](http://www.amazon.com/TDK-MOJO-Portable-Anti-Shock-Directory/dp/B00005MMCL) MP3/CD hybrid player which, coincidentally, also broke after accompanying me to Europe and then to college 2002.

In any case, I worked on getting my PMP300 working again today. I opened it up and everything, but apparently I just needed to push a new AA battery into the battery bay. And it worked! There were nine songs still in the memory. Now all I need to do is see if my mom has the cable (which I think was serial... crap) and get a Win98SE virtual machine running... hmmmmmm.

Maybe it'll replace my iPod Touch! Okay. No. Never. But I am going to take it to work tomorrow.
