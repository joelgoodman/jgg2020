So, you all remember that little music festival I've been doing for seven years? The one that was in May and took up an entire weekend for me? We had some people out from ReelFM.tv filming and they put together a pretty good video with a sort of recap.

Get a feel for what the festival is actually like (if you've never been). It really is a big job that I have loved for the last chunk of my life. But also one I have come to peace with leaving, if it ever came to that.

Anyway, check it out:
