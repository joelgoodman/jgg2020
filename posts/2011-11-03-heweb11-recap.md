I finally have a minute to talk about #heweb11.

If you'll [remember my post last year about #heweb10](https://joelgoodman.co/state-of-highedweb/), I wasn't entirely happy with the quality of the sessions. This year was a big improvement â€“ even if my presentation proposal was denied. The content was certainly better, I think what might have helped was that I went in not expecting much from the sessions, but expecting everything from connecting with people throughout the conference.

And really, that's the crux of working in Higher Ed. The people are amazing.
