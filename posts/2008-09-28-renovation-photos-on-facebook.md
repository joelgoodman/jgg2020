I finally got around to posting all of our renovation photos to [facebook](http://www.new.facebook.com/profile.php?id=152400161&amp;ref=profile). Now that my mom is on facebook, I feel like I can move all of those photos there. They were on Picasa Web Albums, but with the limited space I always hated doing that.

Anyway. If you're interested, and you're my facebook friend, please take a look.
