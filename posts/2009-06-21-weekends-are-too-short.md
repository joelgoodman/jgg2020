I didn't have an incredibly great week last week. It started out pretty good but got increasingly poor as the days went on. This weekend was a blessing of a break. Even though we did a lot of driving I was still able to get away from here and that was good.

Saturday we drove to Poplar Bluff in Southern Missouri for my friend Ryan's wedding. It was a 3 1/2 hour drive, but entirely worth it to see him get married. I also got to see my good friend Rod who lives on the East Coast now.

That was really nice. Today we went to the bookstore and I picked up [Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592403956?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=joggo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592403956) which I've been eyeing for a while. I'm excited to start reading it tonight before bed. I think it's going to be really interesting.

But I am not excited to have work tomorrow. I need a break. I need an extended vacation. I need some time to recover. I haven't had any time away from work since Christmas and I am definitely starting to feel the effects. I was going to take Jessica to Six Flags last week but didn't feel I was able to after some things that happened at work and with Kevin taking Friday off. So hopefully I will be able to work out a long weekend this week and we can take care of these cheap Six Flags tickets I have.

And today was Father's Day. Looks like I will finally be starting on a design for my dad's site which is good. He needs it and I have a good idea for what I'm going to do design-wise. Hopefully Â I'll have some more freelance coming my way in the near future.
