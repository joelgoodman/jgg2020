I'm switching my URL to a subdomain. If you read my updates through a feed reader (ie, Netvibes, Google Reader...) you will probably need to update your feed. I won't put this into effect until **tomorrow evening June 25, 2007**.

My blog will be found at **[http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com)** from then on. This makes it easier for me to track viewers and also manage some of the features I'm trying to build into this beast.

Thanks for reading!
