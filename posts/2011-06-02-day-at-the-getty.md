After flying into ONT, we spent the day at The Getty with Jessica and my parents. I love The Getty. It's my favourite museum in the US. The architecture alone is worth visiting, but they also have great revolving exhibits and a pretty impressive permanent collection.

Of note was the Walker Evans exhibit of his Cuba photos. SO good.

If you've never been to The Getty, you really should. The grounds are amazing.
