Our good friend Danny is spending the next few months in Texas living on a farm and learning organic farming practices. It's a big change from his roots in Columbus, OH. The cool part: he's blogging about it.

Jess and I went to college with Danny. He was in our wedding. He also moved out to California, near where I grew up, befriended my friends there, and then ended up spending Christmas 2007 with me and my family. Whenever Danny comes to visit he brings us something great. Like, freshly roasted coffee or the most amazing ice cream from [Jeni's](http://jenisicecreams.com/) in Columbus. He's a good friend.

So. Now he is living a simpler life in Sunset, TX with a family he hadn't met until four days ago, learning to farm. His blog is just starting out, but let's give him some readership and support and maybe we'll learn a few things too.
