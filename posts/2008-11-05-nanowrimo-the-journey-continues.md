I am 12ish% done with my novel with 25ish days left in this writing intensive marathon. I think I even have a decent story and some direction coming on, after four days of writing. It hasn't been asÂ  hard as I anticipated, but it's not exactly easy to come up with a story on the fly either.

And I will for sure do it again next year. It's awesome
