I feel like we might just live in the future now. My iPad came today. I am blogging from it in my browser. In WordPress. On a touch based keyboard.

If that's not the future I don't know what is. At this moment I don't really care that much about flying cars. This is pretty slick.

Though I will probably use my Bluetooth keyboard more for these long range typing escapades.

One small thing to note. Doesn't look I can use the WYSIWYG editor in mobile safari. Bummer.
