We're in West Virginia. Christmas was nice and we've been lounging around, seeing friends, watching tv and movies. We went to Cincinnati yesterday and met up with Jessica's cousins, aunt, and grandma. We went to the conservatory and out to eat, then to IKEA.

I've been really tired and have rediscovered my need for a new laptop. So. In the next couple of months I believe I will be procuring one.

We're flying up to Detroit on New Years day for my great grandma's 100th birthday. The original plan was to drive up and leave Cors at Danny's house. But this way we can leave him here at the Hunts. We got a good deal on tickets.

Anyway, I'm going to do other things. Just felt I should update. I am still alive! Yes, I am.
