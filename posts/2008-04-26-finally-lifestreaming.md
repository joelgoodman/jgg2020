I got it I got it! Thanks to a cool site I found and a plugin based on Keiran Delaney's SimpleLife, I am now lifestreaming without a ton of php throw-up all over the screen.

[Profilactic.com](http://www.profilactic.com) (yeah... I know) and the WordPress plugin that works with it is pretty awesome. Plus I can manage over 100 different profiles (if I had that many) on the one site. It's pretty good and super easy. So, until SimpleLife works and has better features, I think I'll be sticking with profilactic.
