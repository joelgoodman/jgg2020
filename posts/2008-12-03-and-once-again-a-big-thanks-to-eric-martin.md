I've written about [Eric Martin](http://www.ericmmartin.com) and his [work](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/2008/05/08/plugin-simple-modal-contact-form/) before, and how I believe him to be an incredibly decent human being. But he's more than that. Eric's helping me get my head around jQuery as I attempt to roll out a menu enhancement over at AgapeFest.com. Thanks for the help Eric!

Head over to his [site](http://www.ericmmartin.com) and take a look at the cool stuff he's doing with jQuery and Python. And use his SimpleModal plugin! It's excellent.
