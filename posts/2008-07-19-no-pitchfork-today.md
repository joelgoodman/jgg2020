Well, Jessica and I were going to drive up to Chicago today for the Pitchfok Music Festival, but after checking the weather we decided not to.

Thunderstorms are predicted for all day in Chicago and with a 10 hour round trip drive and no guarantee the show won't get rained out, we decided we'll stay home. And I bought tickets to see Vampire Weekend at the Pageant in September (a week and a half before my birthday).

Vampire Weekend was half of the reason we wanted to go, Jarvis Cocker was the other. So. We're disappointed, but it's okay. Especially since Vampire Weekend will be in STL a couple of months. At least we won't have to do the 10 hour drive and $60 for gas and money spent for food up there... We just put that toward the Pageant show.
