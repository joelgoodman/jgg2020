Yeah, I must.

Geez. What's wrong with me? I guess part of it is that I've been working on my academic site, [A Not-So-Commonplace Book](http://www.joelgoodman.co). Part of it is that I've been taking a break during my 3-week summer break. And part is that I've been busy with jobs for [Department 3](http://www.departmentthree.com). Which has been awesome.

So, this week the Summer term at The New School started up. We made a trip to Rochester, NY as well to see our great friends Micah and Stephanie get married. It was a fun time filled with food, record shopping, driving, beer, baseball, bonfires... oh and Niagara Falls!

So now I'm back to the grind of school. I'm really excited about my classes too. I'm taking Aesthetics of Interactive Design with Jörg Müller and Micro Narratives with Philip Kain. It's going to be a great summer.

Looking forward to rolling out my new and improved site once WP 3.0 is released a few weeks.
