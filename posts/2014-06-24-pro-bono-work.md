A little over a month ago I decided I was going to help my old high school out and redesign their website. I had done their website about three years ago and it was certainly beginning to show its age. So I offered to do the work *pro bono* as a sort of alumni gift to them.

I quickly realized that the seal I had designed last time around was not going to work for my desire to give them a mobile-first responsive design so I tacked on a logo redesign for them. With AVCS being a Christian school and their mascot being the "Warrior" I needed to balance simplicity in design while maintaining imagery that communicated some central themes.

So I moved from a detailed seal with a sword to a [shield and cross logo](http://d.pr/i/sAAI/4rkkU72E) that I feel works really well. It scales pretty decently and looks, at the very least, current. I think the Shield + Cross logo will serve them well for years to come.

The new website is clean, modern, and completely device independent. It looks great on small screens and large screens. I included a few new features for them:

- **Homepage Slideshow** -- The slider on the homepage is simpler, cleaner, and quicker. It scales a lot better than the previous version of the feature.
- **Person Listings** -- I added a manager for person profiles so that faculty and staff can be managed in one area and dynamically pulled onto their respective pages.
- **Homepage Calls to Action** -- I created a utility for them to add calls to action on the homepage to call out specific things they want users to do.

Overall I'm pretty happy with how it all turned out. Along with a new website and new logo I chose new fonts for the school to use in their materials and my hope is that they can stick to using those things along with my style guide recommendations. If they commit to it, I think their marketing will be top-notch in relation to other private Christian schools in the whole country, even.
