My back has been killing me the last four days or so. I'm not sure why or how it happened but it's been rough to stand up even, and today it's even been hurting to sit in my chair at my desk.

I guess that means it's time to see the chiropractor. I haven't been to on since I was a lot younger. But I'm excited for my back to feel better to be able to put gutters up this weekend. And garden more.

We planted our tomatoes yesterday and I tilled up some of our dirt where we're going to plant other plants. We'll probably grill with Micah on Saturday too. So that will be fun!

Oh and Jessica's sister (and a friend) will be staying with us Saturday night on their way back to WV/VA.
