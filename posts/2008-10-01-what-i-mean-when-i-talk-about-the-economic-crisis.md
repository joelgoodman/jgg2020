If you've asked me what bills were proposed to stop the economic crisis or why I say Democrats were responsible for it, this video does a pretty good job of summing it up. And will give you far more sources for the info than I have.

Disregard the last 15 seconds or so. I think this video would've been enough to speak for itself. But the content is backed up and well sourced.
