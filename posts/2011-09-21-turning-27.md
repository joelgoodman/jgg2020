Tomorrow I turn 27 years old. And there's nothing witty or wise for me to say. This is a year where I've just plugged along and that makes the changing of years void of any sort of creative words.

This past year I've built a ton of websites with [Dept. 3](http://www.dept3.com) for clients like [Eliza Dushku](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/portfolio/eliza-dushku/), [Vita Chambers](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/portfolio/vita-chambers/), [Denison Witmer](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/portfolio/denison-witmer/), and [Anthem Films](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/portfolio/anthem-films/). I've been playing a lot more bass and I've made a lot of progress on my master's. And I bought my first new car.

I launched 8 websites in six months, redesigned my own blog...

This year was spent on the web, wasn't it? Pretty much all I did this year was create the web, or write about it. The results? Well, a lot to go in the portfolio and on my résumé and wrists that ache, a lot.

I'm not sure what my 27th year will be like. I know I'll finish my MA. But beyond that, I think the year is wide open.
