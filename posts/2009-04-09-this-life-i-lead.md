Jess and I have decided to stay in Greenville for one more year. Not the plan we've been trying to have, but one that will probably work out better for us in the long run. In the meantime I'm looking for graduate programs in New Media Management or production to apply to for the 2010 Fall semester.

Here in Greenville I have a good, solid job that I won't lose and Jessica has more opportunity to get a job here as well. So we can spend the next year saving and paying down school debt before making a move to one of the coasts.

Right now I'm looking at programs at Emerson, Syracuse U and the New School. But I haven't done much research yet.

I've got a good amount of freelance work here and don't see that letting up anytime soon. Plus we'll have a year to enjoy our finally finished house (done this summer... or else!). Maybe we can finally unpack all of our things!  We haven't been able to do that since we were first married.

So. There it is. Midwest, you are home for a little longer.
