I'm so glad I got a weekend this weekend. It's been nice to get some paying work done.

The site I've been working on uses my [Prodigious](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/portfolio/prodigious-2/) Wordpress template with some specific changes for the new artist.

One of those was pulling in gig data from the XML that ArtistData.com provides. It would be a heck of a lot easier if that site had any kind of API instead of making it ridiculously hard for us smart internet-types to get to what we need.

In any case, that was my weekend. I'll post later when the site is live. Probably in a few days. But it's looking good. If you want to play around with the theme itself, check it out [here](http://prodigious.thegoodmanblog.com).
