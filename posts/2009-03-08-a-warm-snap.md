The weather the second half of last week and today has been amazing. Given, it is quite windy, but the 70ยบ temps make up for it. We've got hyacinths and tulips popping up from out of the ground, were able to put our 'winterized' plants out in the real sunshine today, took puppy for a walk. It's be gorgeous.

So gorgeous, in fact, that I haven't wanted to sit in front of this laptop and work. There were other obstacles, however, to my productivity. First off, I have a logo from one of my clients, but no colour choice. And the site I need to design is dependent upon their print material colour palette. And I don't have any of that info.

It's going to be a fairly in-depth build out too.

This week we do dotCMS training at work. And that means we are getting ever closer to rolling out the new site. Hopefully by the end of the month. That will be a huge amount of stress off of my shoulders. Then I can focus on helping the school communicate better online.

Also. I should have a grad school answer by Wednesday. If you're the praying type, I would greatly appreciate prayers. I'm stressed about it. I really hope I get in.

And on that note, I leave you with a photo of my dog not wanting to eat his breakfast.
