From Paula Scher's Â [*Make It Bigger*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568985487?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thegoodmacom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1568985487):

> Focus groups can't be expected to respond positively to something new, because if it's something really new it's going to look "too something," which means not sufficiently like other things like it that already exist in the marketplace. Focus testing tells you what the consumer already accepts, not what they will accept in the future.
