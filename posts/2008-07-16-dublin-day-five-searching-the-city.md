We were SO tired. I hadn't realized just how exhausted I was from the trip. But what woke me up wasn't the light from outside or the noise from the guesthouse. Nor was it my alarm that didn't go off. It was the smell of eggs, bacon, baked beans, toast, sausage and tomatoes wafting up from the kitchen. Every morning it was like this. Sooooo good smelling.

Jess and I kind of rushed our showers so we could make it downstairs before breakfast was through. And what a breakfast it was. The three of us ate and headed back upstairs to grab a guide book and plan out our day. We figured out we wanted to do City Centre to see the sights, so we figured out the bus routes and grabbed our bags. About 15 minutes later we stepped out onto O'Connell Street.

We found out that we could walk just about everywhere. We stopped in the tourism office to pick up some postcards to send home and started walking. Down across the Liffey we ended up heading into Trinity College Dublin and walking around. After seeing the campus, I can't believe Ivan left it for GC. It's a pretty fantastic place with old buildings and green lawns and ancient trees. We skipped the Book of Kells because Jessica had heard you don't really even get to look at it and headed outside of the gates and over toward Dublin Castle.

We entered the gates of Dublin Castle and saw the last remaining original Norman tower. Wow. Then we headed to the Chester Beatty Library and Museum where we looked at loads of old manuscripts, illuminations, illustrations and books from different cultures. It was really cool ad interesting. But I like that sort of thing.

Anyway. We walked back to Temple Bar and ate lunch in a restaurant that ended up being way more expensive that we thought. And all I had was stew.

Afterward we decided Temple Bar was kind of lame and headed off toward St. James' Gate and the Guinness Storehouse. The tour was pretty cool, though not stuff I didn't already know. Still, the view of Dublin from the Gravity Bar was worth the price and the tour. And the latt√© I had on the way up was great.

We descended and headed back to the bus line (it was a long walk from St James' Gate) and went back to the B&B. Finally we left for dinner at the Cat & Cage (where I had a pretty good steak sandwich), and to the Ivy House for dessert (which was even more fantastic) and a quick email check. And finally, sleep back at ABC.
