If you're a fan of music (and if you aren't there is certainly something wrong with you), then you simply must head over to Stereogum and download my good friend [Andr√©](http://www.andreandliz.com)'s newest RAC remix compilation. FOR FREE.

It's excellent. This is the [link](http://stereogum.com/archives/mp3/stereogum-presents-rac-vol-1_010342.html) you need.

Give it a listen and tell me what you think. Then go to the [RAC website](http://theremixcompany.co.uk).
