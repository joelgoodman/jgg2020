Last weekend I ordered a brand spanking new Nikon D80 camera body and a Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. Tomorrow, my gear should arrive in the mail. On the 8th, my battery grip and extra battery will show up with a UV filter and extra battery.

Tomorrow I will also be placing my order for a Tamron 28-70mm zoom and a 70-300mm zoom. I am SO excited. Photos to follow.
