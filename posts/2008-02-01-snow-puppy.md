We woke up this morning to eight inches of snow on the ground, cars, trash cans... it's gorgeous. It snowed most of yesterday and just kept snowing. We had at least a couple of inches when we went to Andr√©'s house for LOST last night, and snowed all night long. It was still snowing this morning when I went to shovel the walkway down to our car.

I also had to clear some space for our dwarf puppy. It would have been tough for him to use the facilities (as it were) in 8" of snow. So I shoveled a small patch for him. When I got him outside, he still wanted to play in the snow though.
