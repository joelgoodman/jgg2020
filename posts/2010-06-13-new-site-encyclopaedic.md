Just announced, my wife's site -- [waysideviolet.com](http://www.waysideviolet.com) -- has a brand new design.

I started designing this yesterday and got it coded out today. I had a rough time nailing down the aesthetic for her site this time around. But after a few other ideas for other projects (that didn't get used), I cobbled something together that I am pretty proud of.

I think the new template is pretty classy and sophisticated. And it still makes every photo Jess chooses stand out.

The template itself is built for [WordPress 3.0](http://www.wordpress.org) and makes use of the new Nav Menu manager and post thumbnails. I've also left it open for a later public release by having and interchangeable, dynamic header image as well as the image for the background.

The design also makes a lot of use of CSS3, so I recommend checking it out in an up-to-date version of Safari, Firefox or Chrome. Go let her know what you think! The template is titledÂ *Encyclopaedic.*
