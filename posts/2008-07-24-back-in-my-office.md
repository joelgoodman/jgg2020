Yeah, I know. Clever caption. :) - I forgot I had this photo until last night. So I found it and put it in my Flickr stream. That little bird was just sitting on the fencing on the South-side of campus, North-side of College Ave. while the East wing of Hogue Hall was coming down. It was just chillin. Wasn't scared of us at all.

So... I'm back in the office today, which is nice. Air conditioning, being connected to the web again (not just via my iPod). I wish my Premiere software was in so I could get to work on some of this video I have to do, but I guess that means I'll mess with photos and do a few EDU updates.
