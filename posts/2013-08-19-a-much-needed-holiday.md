Yesterday we got up early and took a flight from Austin to Los Angeles to Palm Springs. This is the second Ace Hotel we've stayed at and while it's not the same vibe at all as Ace New York, it has been a great day so far.

I left my laptop at home so that I couldn't be suckered into working. That means this is a real vacation. That also means that I will have a lot more to post once we are home.
