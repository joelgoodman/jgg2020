We made it back. It was an interesting weekend. Here are some photos.

First we went to a restaurant called Buca di Beppo. It was terrible. The food was horrible and the interior was like, disco Italy. So I sat and talked politics with my father-in-law and told Jessica's relatives about our trip to Portugal and Dublin. We stayed too long and they kicked us out. Then we stood outside for an hour. Fun fun.

Next, we drove to Jessica's grandma's house in Taylor Mill, KY. Gramma Jo is the best. Jess and I spent the night with her. It was nice to see her! We even saw ducks this morning! Then we went to IKEA and came home
