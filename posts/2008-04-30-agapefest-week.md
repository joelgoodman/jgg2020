It's my sixth Â year with the [festival](http://www.agapefest.com). Sixth. That's a long time. During four of those I was a student and progressed in this manner: Vendors Coordinator (freshman), Director of Artist Relations (sophomore), Assistant Director (junior), Executive Director (senior). Last year I kind of helped out unofficially and shot video footage. This year I am Operations Advisor to the festival and am paid.

But what's interesting is that I am still overlooked. I am the person with the longest, most consistent practical experience with this event, but I am sidestepped. Which, to tell the truth, kind of hurts. But more brings out my ESTJ nature as well as my number five [strength](http://www.strengthsfinder.com) of Competition. I really want to show them that I'm right. I want to just be included in talks. Have my name on it. I feel like I've worked really hard to put this festival right and have invested a lot of myself into it. And in the end I don't even get directly associated with the festival.

I'm not the kind of person that wants to get paid and just do my work and shut up. I'd rather not get paid and feel more directly connected than I do now than anything else. At the same time, I don't have the time to put into an event like this and not be compensated. I just mean that I want to be included since I have helped put the festival into the good position it's in now.

Okay, enough whining. I just had to get that out someplace. Anyone want to start a festival with me on the East coast in two or three years?
