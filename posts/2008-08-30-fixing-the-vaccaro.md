So, I have this pretty sweet guitar called a Vaccaro. There's a long and interesting history about the company, but suffice it to say my guitar has an aluminum neck encased in maple, a metal headstock in the shape of a "V" with a single coil at the neck and a humbucker in the bridge position. String through body, 3-way switch, coil tap. It's pretty cool. And I'm trying to sell it.

Now, back in college when I had money I could spend on cool stuff, I bought a Seymour-Duncan SH1B '59. It's a humbucker specifically made to go in the bridge position and sound pretty vintage. And it certainly does. We soldered it in Junior year (I think it was) and it was pretty cool, I guess. But it didn't live up to what I had hoped it would do. Then a year later I got a '69 Thinline Tele reissue and didn't really touch the Vaccaro anymore.

I picked it up today to play it through my '73 Champ and see how it's sounding and feeling, and it didn't make a peep. Uh-oh.

So now I have it opened up on my coffee table and I'm thinking of putting the old humbucker back in. The SH1 is cool, but it's got a single conducter and that means I can't use the coil tap - which is a bummer. The old pickup sounds good too.

My dilemma in doing this is that I can't find the tips to my soldering iron. And I can't find my wood burning tool that has a soldering tip (so that it can serve a dual purpose). So I'm kind of stuck. I probably should just buy a nice soldering gun and case, but I've never felt the need to spend $30 on a soldering gun. I should just bite the bullet someday and do it.

Anyway. If you know where my soldering iron tips are, let me know!
