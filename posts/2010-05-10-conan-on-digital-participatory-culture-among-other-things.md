During his visit to the Google campus, Conan ended up speaking on digital participatory culture and how the power of the online masses has affected his life, his live show, and his future as an entertainer. He gets it, and he embraces it. It's a great talk, really funny, and Conan gives some insightful remarks.

The section I'm referring to starts about 17 minutes in, but you really should watch the whole thing. It's hysterical.
