I am in a state of remembering why I stopped reading fiction for a while. The stories sometimes make me want things I can't have. I think I might have been much more a romantic, dare I say a rebel or free spirit, had I read more fiction during high school and the beginning of college. I think things would have turned out much differently.

This is just speculation of course, but I probably would not have gone to the school I graduated from. I probably would have left and backpacked across Europe before college. When I say Europe, I mean most if not all of Europe. I guess I'd be trying to recapture that 1970s era spirit of the wandering young man who picks up work just to get to his next destination.

I probably would have gone to school in Europe (which, in hindsight, I probably should have done regardless) - the UK or France, perhaps.

I would not have ended up in a small midwestern town working in web development at a tiny Christian liberal arts college. At the same time, I'm not sure my personality would have compelled me to do all of those things. I was terribly naive about what I wanted to do "when I grew up". I wish I had been a little bit more realistic.

In any case, there are a lot of adventures I will not have, but that's the same with everyone. Being stuck where we are right now just makes me ponder what would have happened if I had made other decisions. I feel stuck again, immobile. Trying to get away but held in place by my responsibilities. But that's life.
