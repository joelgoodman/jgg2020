I'm really excited for the official/stable WordPress 2.5 release. I've got RC1 running this site on a backup/test install. It is awesome. I'm ready to get away from MU anyway... kind of sucks in a lot of ways. Anyway, the 2.5 revisions are excellent, so if you run WordPress or have been thinking of it, the release of WP 2.5 is the perfect opportunity to upgrade or start using.
