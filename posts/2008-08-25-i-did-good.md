Well, I did pretty good. Better than last time.

Thank you for the moral support, my digital friends. Next task: Apply to grad school. Task after that: Get the WGRN site live. Task following that one: Getting AgapeFest.com live. Task after all of those: Getting two sites designed for my dad.

Anyway. yay. Hopefully grad school next summer!!!
