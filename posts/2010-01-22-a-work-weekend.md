This week has been absolutely great. I received a lot of good news, had friends over for dinner, got a lot done at work, played LEGO Rock Bandâ€¦ And now I'm ready for a weekend of working for myself.

My first task this weekend is to get the tea@elevensies site up and running. It's taken too long and I feel bad. But I did have a rough stretch the past six months or so that deterred me from getting it all wrapped up -- still, not a good excuse. This weekend is the weekend, however, to bust out this site for Ashley and Char. And then probably see what Ash wants to change (she apparently is over her design now). But at least it will be another project down.

The second issue I'm going to try to wrap up is this site. I've got most of a new design mocked up and sitting in Photoshop, just waiting for me to bring it to life in HTML5 and CSS3. So this site will change in the **near** future. And for the better, I think.

Third, I need get started on redesigning Jessica's blog. Her new branding is amazing and I want to get it up and running for her, as well as a complete graphics package for her Etsy shop.

It is nice to have some time to work on personal design and coding. Stress is gone, and that goes a long way toward the proper motivation in these sorts of situations. Things are exciting!
