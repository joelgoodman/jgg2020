I didn't write anything yesterday for NaNoWriMo. I wrote about 300 words during my lunch today. I think I'll have to try and write a ton this evening when I get home. I need to get that wordcount up.

On a brighter note, one of the sites I manage is doing really well hits-wise (for its normal rankings anyway). That's the one thing that is making me feel good about today. That and I drank Jasmine tea at lunch. Mmmm.

And! Jessica is back from her field trip. Which means I can hang out with her when I get home. Though I will most likely be ignoring her for the sake of noveling. Maybe this is a sad night.
