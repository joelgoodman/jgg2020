Today was my birthday. Twenty-six years. That first quarter-century is long gone at this point.

A lot has changed this year. My little sister got married, I quit my job at Greenville College, Jess and I moved to Chicago for a job at Trinity International University, I started graduate school and my freelance is taking off. So much movement, some more progression. It feels good, actually.

I think this year will bring some conclusions, hopefully more creative growth and some defining moments. I am so thankful for the friends I have made during my 25th year of life. Wayne, my good friend and colleague, is the most caring person I've ever met. He made the image on this post for me and taped it to my door this morning. Even in the midst of a few rough weeks for him, he gave. He took me out for sushi too!

And our friends from church all showed up to our house for birthday pie. I am so encouraged when I think about the amazing people we have met and so blessed to know them and live different parts of my life with them.

Thank you. Thank you all for the part you play in my life.
