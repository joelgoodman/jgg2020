I'm working on version 2.0 of this blog. And today it really started coming together. I've got the basic layout mocked up. I'll start slicing and creating graphics this week and hopefully coding soon.

All I've got to say is that I think it's pretty awesome. And I'm really excited about it. If I can get it together I will be very happy. The new design probably will not support IE 6. It will be as standards compliant as I can make it. But most of you reading this blog are intelligent and savvy enough to have a modern, standards-supporting browser. And I love you for it.

If you want a sneak peak... let me know in the comments.
