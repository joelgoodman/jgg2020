Jess and I are going to see The Elms tonight in St Louis. Should be a ton of fun.

I love $6 shows. And spur-of-the-moment concert outings. Plus I'm not sure we've been to a concert this summer yet.

It'll be a good break from all of this junk going on with work projects. I found out we need to put some Chinese content on the site.

Yeah, I don't really speak Chinese...
