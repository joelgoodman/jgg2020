Not really. It's been a nice respite from such a busy weekend. Going through these photos the last couple days has been great too. I'm hoping I can get a few more of the attendees to join up on the Flickr group page and submit their photos.

I'll probably have to take a break from these tomorrow and do the Hogue Hall gallery. The other project this week is the Commencement powerpoint. Mainly because the other offices here are procrastinators and take forever to get things done. And when they get them done they have to be redone. It's annoying.

I'm happy the semester is coming to a close. Once a bunch of the students are gone we'll be left with our friends here and a bit more free time. Especially after alumni events in June. We'll get our flooring done and then fly to Portugal and Ireland. The rest of summer here in Greenville will be more calm. Then school will start again and stuff will pick up.

But right now I need to get everything in order. Maybe I'll clean up my desk too. It needs to be. We should paint this office.
