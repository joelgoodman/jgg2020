I'm standing out on Hogue Lawn manning my time lapse camera waiting for the catwalk to come down. Originally I was told 7 am but now it's been pushed back to this afternoon. Which sucks because it is beastly hot out here and I can't just leave this camera.

Looks like they're demoing a tree at the moment. We'll see what happens. Tomorrow I will hopefully be inside doing this. Maybe 4th LaDue or the roof of Janssen.
