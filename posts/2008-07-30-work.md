I've been working on a PantherNet redesign for the last two days. PantherNet is our intranet portal for students, faculty and staff - and it's lame. At least it has been. But I am actually really excited about this design. Thanks to [Harry](http://mynameisharry.tumblr.com/) and a bunch [of](http://ivewrittenitdown.com/) [my](http://www.jms2k.com/) [other](http://pedalboy.net) friends' opinions... it's looking pretty great.

Once it's finalized, I'll post a screenshot (if you ask me really nice, I'll link you up to one beforehand). Wow. Never thought I'd actually like this one.
