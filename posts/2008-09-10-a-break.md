If I may, I'd like to mention something non-political. Not only will this give me a breather, but hopefully you'll get one as well.

Tonight Jessica and I are going to see these fellas:

Vampire Weekend at the Pageant tonight. This will make up for not seeing them at Pitchfork (when it was raining all weekend and a five hour drive to get there).

And this weekend we are driving to Cincinnati for Jessica's Aunt's birthday. It'll be fun (we get to go to IKEA!) and I will be eating excellent food made by Grandma Jo who is a fine southern lady with mean kitchen skills. Be envious. But not too much. If you ask nicely I might bring some pecan pie back for you!
