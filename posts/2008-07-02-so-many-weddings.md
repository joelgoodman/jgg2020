I guess this is that summer. I think everyone experiences a summer like this, and this is the year I'm experiencing it. The summer of your life where it seems like a friend, old or new, is getting married. Every weekend.

A good friend from high school and growing up in church got married this past weekend. One of my sister's friends and another church friend got married this past weekend too. Jessica and I are headed to Portugal for another [wedding](http://andreandliz.com).

Tons of people at school got married this year too. It's pretty crazy.

But it's also been kind of... I don't want to say sad, because it's not sad. I'm not sure what the emotion is, but I wish I could've been at these weddings for my old friends. Especially seeing photos pop up on facebook and things. The best I'm able to do is give them a "congratulations" on their wall. I suppose I could send a card, but I personally didn't get an invite (though my family did, so I was included in those), and they weren't able to make it to our wedding because we're so far away.

In any case. To my friends who have recently been married, I wish you a big congratulations and I want you to know how excited and happy I am for you! It's been great getting to know you for so many years and just exciting to see that God has brought you to someone who loves you! Good luck and best wishes and we need to get together sometime so I can meet your new spouse!
