Yeah, we actually went out to Edwardsville to get coffee beans at Starbucks. Best Buy had $30 worth of iTunes cards for $25 so we bought some of those for family stockings and whatnot. BUT we also found the two-disc version of* Across the Universe* for $5.

At Borders we found the music edition of *Romeo & Juliet* (the Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes one) for $5. And then at Target we found the third Pirates of the Carribean movie for $5. So. Pretty good day. And stuff wasn't *too* crazy.

I still feel bad for everyone that has to work retail on Black Friday. I do not miss those days at all. So, if you had to be in a retail store, dealing with every kind of customer imagineable, you have my sympathy and warm thoughts. You're a strong person.
