I got a NAS!

My D-Link DNS-321 came yesterday and is running well. Although... I haven't put any data on it. I've sort of been messing with fun plugs and features and stuff.

The greatest benefit to thisÂ [NAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached%20storage) is the Linux kernel underneath. That lets me add whatever features I want (within reason and skillset anyway). So I'm busy setting up Bonjour (for our Macs), Firefly (for iTunes sharing), and a bunch of other things.

I need to brush up on my Linux commands... because I am way out of practice when it comes to working in a terminal. But it's going okay. I'm gettin' there.

Photos of the NAS to come, I hope. If you've got tips for working with the DNS-321/323 PLEASE let me know in the comments or with the Contact link at the top. I'd appreciate any help I can get.

Hope you're having a good week!
