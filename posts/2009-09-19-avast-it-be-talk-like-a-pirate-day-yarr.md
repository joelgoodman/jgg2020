Today be the day where all good lads and lasses disregard their noble upbringing and embrace the humble words of a pirate. If ye happen across a mate who sounds to be speaking in a foreign tongue, do not shun him. Nay embrace his callous heart with a hearty greeting and loud "YARR!"

It be also me friends Sam and Melissa's wedding day. And as such I know not how me custom will go over. A pirate in a tuxedo may perhaps be a strange site.

Well now me wife and I shall address the victuals awaiting us on that fair shore called Denny's fore disembarking for our port of call, the wedding.

YARR!

Don't forget ye must [tweet like a pirate](http://tweetlikeapirate.com) too!
