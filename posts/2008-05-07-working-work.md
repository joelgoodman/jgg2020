Taking a break from AgapeFest flickr uploads today. I had a few things on my list including getting the gallery feature on the Hogue Hall site working. And it is. Check!

Had a couple news stories to post. Did it. Check!

Tweaked a few things on Hogue Hall. The letterhead logo is now clickable to get back to the main blog page. Check! Spacing was fixed too in the sidebar. Except that IE is horrible. Check!

I started a bit of work on what will be the Portfolio section of this blog. I'm not sure that I want to leave it in WordPress, but I am starting to lean that direction. Shadowbox does a lot that I like and it's helping on the portfolio front.

A few plugin reviews coming up:

- SimpleModal Contact
- Shadowbox
- Last.FM RPS - just look at that widget! It's beautiful

I also found tons of interesting stuff last night. Check them out in my WTFMO widget.
