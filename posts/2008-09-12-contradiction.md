> *The fact is that a vote for Mr Obama demands uncritical subservience to the irrational, anti-empirical proposition that the past holds no clues about the future, that promise is wholly detached from experience. The second-greatest story ever told, perhaps.*

The article this came from is far too well-written to be from an American journalist or pundit. It actually came from The Times Online and is, I think, a particularly insightful look into our current political climate. And it came from Britain.
There is a difference between Speechmaker Obama and Politician Obama. He speaks of change and breaking down the walls of bipartisanship. But he hasn't backed it up with voting action as he has towed his party's line consistently and accurately during his career thus far. That combined with his desire to [win no matter what](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-070403obama-ballot,0,1843097.story) is a dangerous contradiction to his eloquent rhetoric.
