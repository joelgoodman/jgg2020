Had our kickoff meeting with Dotmarketing today about implementing dotCMS. We're getting it all rolling. I'm hoping to set up a tech/development/process blog on EDU to keep track of all of that as we go through it.

The target launch looks like early to mid March, which is awesome. And Kevin starts work on Monday so we should be getting this cranked out pretty quick. First design meeting is Monday.Â  yay!
