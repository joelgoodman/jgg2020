I am hella tired.

We took danny to the airport and stopped by H&M and grabbed some Penn Station. Now I'm staring at my computer in my office making some updates to our website.

And falling asleep.

On a happier note, we got the *Goodbye, Lenin!* special edition DVD in the mail today. I know what I'll be watching tonight. zzzzzzzzzzzzz.
