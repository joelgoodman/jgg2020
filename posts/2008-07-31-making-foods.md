Micah's coming over for dinner and I am making tequila-lime shrimp fajitas. And they will be delicious. This is one of my favourite recipes because it fries well, grills well and tastes SO good.

I also made guacamole. I've been craving mexican food more from the Baja side of the country. Out here Mexican food means like, middle of the country, land-locked, heavy flavours sort of food. I'm much more into that fresh vegetables, bright & crisp flavours, seafood, lime... mmmmm smooth cheeses. Sounds so good. So the closest I can get is to cook it at home.

I miss [Rubios](http://www.rubios.com/). And I wish we had one here. Even a Baja Fresh would be better then freaking Qdoba or Chipotle.

Anyway. Here's to making good food at home!
