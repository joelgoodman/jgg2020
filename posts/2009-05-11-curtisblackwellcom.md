It's the time of the year when the Digital Media near-graduates give their portfolio presentations so I've been spending a lot of time giving advice, troubleshooting and, now, grading their portfolios. It's a lot of fun. I am really excited to be teaching Web Design next semester. Hopefully I'll be able to get the newer kids loving web design as much I do.

One of my good friends, Curtis, just launched his portfolio/site tonight. And I want to give him a plug because:

1. He's and awesome guy and put together a really cool site design
2. I helped him a bit in getting it together

I didn't realise the sheer body of work that he's put together just in the last 6 months or so. It's pretty amazing. In any case, please check his stuff out.
