We're getting settled into our new place and I'm starting on some work. Should be a busy few months as we get accustomed to everything. Finally had internet installed at home today. Our building has a contract with Time Warner Cable which is not only expensive, but apparently has lag spikes in the evening. We'll see how it goes.

I'm in the process of getting everything switched over (insurances, changes of address, etc.) and setting up our apartment. It's starting to feel like home. I'm excited to get to work on some new projects and on some continuing projects.
