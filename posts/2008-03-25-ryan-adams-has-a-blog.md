Prolific, stream of consciousness... he's just freaking hilarious to me. So I saw this on [Paste Magazine](http://www.pastemagazine.com) this morning -- he started a [blog](http://dradamsfilms.com/)! And apparently he's working on a new album. Let's hope that it's better than [*Easy Tiger*](http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Tiger-Ryan-Adams/dp/B000P29B1W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1206454629&amp;sr=8-1)*. *Okay, not that I didn't like the album, I just thought it wasn't "up to par". Clean = not as good sounding for Ryan Adams (in my opinion).

In any case, check out the blog. It's so funny. He's always entertaining.
