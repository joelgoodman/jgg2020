Jessica and I have been in California for the last week or so. It's been pretty great. And today is Christmas!

It's 6:30ish a.m., and no one is awake yet; no one but us, that is. We put our own stocking stuffers in everyone's stockings this morning -- the puppy woke us up to remind us. Now we're in waiting mode for everyone to get up. Jessica has a problem getting back to sleep on Christmas morning ;).

We asked Danny a few days ago if he would spend Christmas with us. He got here yesterday afternoon and went to church with us and spent the night. We watched "Battle of the Nutcrackers" last night on Ovation TV. Crazy. Check out Mark Morris's *The Hard Nut*, it's insane.

It's good to have Danny here. We missed him, and it seems like he may have missed us. Coping with California can be tough for people not from here.

It's been great in any case. Have a Happy Christmas!
