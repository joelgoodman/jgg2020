After a wonderful day of other academic departments assuming I am going to do things for them before they actually talk to me about said things, listening to staff bicker about how they don't think the school likes them as much the faculty, taking photos after dinner and then promptly having to fix a COMPLETELY flat tire...

I have finally re-templated this site. The design is in beta. There's a lot to fix. A few things to style. But hopefully you can still enjoy it!
