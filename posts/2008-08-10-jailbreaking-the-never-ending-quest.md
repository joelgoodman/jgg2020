I am once again jailbreaking my iPod Touch. Wish me luck. So far Pwnage Tool 2.0.2 is running smoothly. But it does take a while for it to build the IPSW.

Anyway, there are kittenz in the pwnage tool and that makes me smile. We'll see how this all turns out. I haven't jailbroken this beast since before 2.0 released... and 2.0 is a different animal.

UPDATE:

It worked well. Took me awhile to get it into DFU, but I ended up getting it finally. I'm so glad to be rid of that ugly default iPod/iPhone theme.
