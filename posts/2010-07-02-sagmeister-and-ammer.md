We saw this interactive piece at the Art Institute of Chicago today. I thought it was cool and directly connects to the Aesthetics of Interactive Design course I am taking this summer.

Basically, you walk in front of the projector and a sensor captures your movement. Your movement messes with the spider web that read "Being Not Truthful Always Works Against Me". Pretty neat.
