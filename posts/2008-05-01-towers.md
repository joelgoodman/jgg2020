Stage went up. It was looking stormy. But that's alright. We didn't really get any rain out there. But I took this with my cool fisheye attachment. It's totally 90s but I don't care. It's so much fun to shoot with.

Scotty is here and I was really happy to see him. I miss that guy all the time. I'll probably hang out with him at FOH while he's running lights. It'll be awesome.

I am already worn out too. It was a fun day. And it's amazing to think that we'll have 5000 people here tomorrow ready to have an amazing weekend. Just a bunch of kids that have been waiting for months to come see David Crowder and Relient K (and others). It's so cool.

I'll post more photos and details tomorrow (most likely). And I think I'm over that whole being overlooked thing. I think I need to just get over myself and get on with it. Do what I do best: make other people look good. I'll have my day. I may start my own festival. I hope I can someday.
