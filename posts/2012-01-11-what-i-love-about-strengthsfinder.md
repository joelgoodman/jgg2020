*Over the next couple weeks I'll be posting about my top 5 StrengthsFinder Strengths: Futuristic, Strategic, Responsibility, Restorative, and Competition.*

This past year my personal skills and involvement in various projects has diversified a lot. I mean A LOT. I'm now working as Creative Director for a startup and my other design work is being noticed by more than my immediate world. My experience in strategy and future planning is being realized by people I've never directly tried to sell on my personal brand. So I thought it would be interesting, almost 10 years out from when I took first the Gallup StrengthsFinder test, to look through my top 5 strengths and see how they have impacted my life.

When I arrived at Greenville College as a freshman I was introduced to a Strengths-based curriculum. As new students we took the StrengthsQuest test and started classes that taught us not only about our Strengths, but how to use them effectively in school, work, and personal ministry. So much of my journey through undergraduate academics was viewed through the lens of Strengths. In fact, the creator of the system would come and speak to our campus once a year, extolling the virtues that Gallup wanted us to know and love.

It inevitably became the target of numerous inside jokes, the most popular being the pickup line, "What are your Top 5?"

Since you asked, mine are:

1. Futuristic
2. Strategic
3. Responsibility
4. Restorative
5. Competition

Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be looking at each of my top 5 and examining how they've affected me in my work and living. For me, it'll be part nostalgia, part self-evaluation (for as Socrates once said, "The unexamined life is not worth living"). I hope that if you read the series you will come away with a better understanding of my passions, quirks, and thought processes.

Either way, I'll have fun.

If you're not sure what the Gallup StrengthsFinder is, I encourage you to [go get the book](http://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326339059&amp;sr=1-1) and take the sorter. It's fun and enlightening.
