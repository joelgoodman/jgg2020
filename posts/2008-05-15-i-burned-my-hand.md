Last night while cooking what would have been some delicious [steak frites](http://www.chowhound.com/topics/396639), I burned my hand. It was stupid. And now my hand is bandaged, I am having trouble typing and I have to video tape a few events this weekend. Not the best thing to happen.

It got my right palm and three fingers - middle through pinky finger. They kind of hurt but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Some minor blistering.

**UPDATE:**

Harry wanted pictures. It's not that bad... but here you go. My fingers do have blisters on them.

Anyway. That is all
