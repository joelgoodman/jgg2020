About a year and a half or so ago Apple Inc. commissioned a battery recall which included my aging 12" PowerBook G4. Like any self-respecting Apple owner, I sent my battery away and received the replacement for free. I had had that battery for about 2 years and, according to [Coconut Battery](http://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/), I had a good 98% of my original capacity left.

See, as a battery ages it loses its charge capacity. 98% is pretty dang good--with the screen at half-brightness I was still getting 3.5 hours or so. That's good. When it was knew it maxed out at 5 hours with the screen as dim as it would go without being off. Four hours-ish at half-brightness.

So I got the replacement thinking I would basically be getting added time of along battery life. Now, a year and a half later I get nigh 15 minutes at half-brightness. It is horrible. And to purchase a new battery from Apple would be $129. $129 just for it to peter out after not much time.

So I guess it's time to start planning for a new Mac purchase. Probably after they redesign the MacBook Pro line. But I'm still a little bit pissed off about the short life span of my replacement battery.
