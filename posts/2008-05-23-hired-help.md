Last summer we had a local roofing company come and re-roof our house. There was a lot of interior water damage when we first moved in (you can see photos [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/asilentthing/HouseRenovation1)) which meant the roof was shot. So they came out, took about four days to do our roof and left. A lot of our roof is near-flat so they suggested a rubber roof. Which they put up.

The rubber roof was ugly. They left loads of ripples and the trim was terrible. We had them fix the ripples but they told us that the trim was normal. And they said that there's a guarantee along with the roof.

Well, this weekend, being a long weekend and all, I was planning to put up our new gutters. A friend even offered to help me do it tomorrow. Today I pulled out our ladder to take a look and maybe start pulling down the old gutters. It turns out that the roofers nailed the roofing and trim right into our old gutters!

So in order to pull down the old ones, I have to undo everything they secured the roofing material with, pull them down and re-nail the rubber in. It's really annoying. We've dealt with these people more times than should be necessary for a satisfactory job. Now we'll have to see if they agree to come out and fix it.
