Tonight I moved my Ghost blog off of Digital Ocean and over to Ghost Pro (the hosted service by the people that built ghost). I did this for a few reasons, but the main one is that because Digital Ocean requires you point your DNS to their nameservers, they make it extremely difficult to just forward email to an email address.

Instead, I'm now on Ghost Pro with the DNS snugly back at Namecheap (my registrar of choice) and a simple email forward in place.

That said... *if you emailed me in the past two weeks and I never got back to you, I'm sorry. The DigitalOcean DNS stuff is at fault I didn't realize it.*

So. let's see how this hosted service goes.
