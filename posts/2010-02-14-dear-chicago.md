This week is the week. Well, I hope it's the week. We've run into a few snags in this moving process. We did find a place that we're okay with living in for the next year. It's only a 15 minute commute to school, pretty up-to-date, has a fireplace and a garage.

The only problem is that we are still waiting to hear if the lease has gone through. We are supposed to have the movers here on Tuesday, but without a confirmation from the landlords, we don't know if there's a place to have our things delivered to. Hopefully we will hear tomorrow.

I've got a few things to take care of beyond the normal changing of address. For one, we're in a Dish Network contract and I need to know if we'll be able to have a dish installed at our new place. We'll have to see what Dish will do for us if we have to terminate early. Hopefully it won't be too bad.

Sounds like Jessica's parents may come up on Saturday to help us unpack. I'm thinking IKEA for bookcases and Giordano's for some pizza (they've never experienced Chicago-style pizza). In any case, there is a lot to do this week with finishing up work, meeting movers, moving, going to an inauguration, and getting all settled. I start my new job at Trinity a week from Monday.
