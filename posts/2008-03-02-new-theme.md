I finally got around to designing a new theme for my blog here. Actually, it's a test for my new website that I will be working on. I recently registered jggoodman.com and will be hosting my portfolio, blog and other such things there. I'm pretty excited about it. No more WordPressMU (which is a pain in the butt).

This is still a beta release, because I've only spent about a day and a half on it. I'm pretty sure that there are some things that either don't work or are styled incorrectly. If you see any of those, PLEASE leave me a comment telling me what you've found.
