I've been making a few changes here and there the last couple of days. I'm having a CSS issue that I think is due to something in the Sandbox framework I'm using. And it's bugging me: mainly because I can't find the problem. Everything seems correct.

I made a couple of changes in the sidebar, which I think is excellent. One of them is when a single post is viewed, the meta data for the post shows up in the first sidebar. That's cleaned it up a little bit. I'm still working on it. I am, however, really happy with the overall look.

I'm getting tired of having to look at the same 'ol flickr photos in my picture grid. We're planning on getting a D80 in a month or so (as soon as we get our tax refund). So that'll be nice.

Oh! Another note. The LifeStream feature. Well... apparently I can't get the latest version. Because it's not being hosted on the guy's site or on wordpress.org - so, I guess I'm stuck until it shows up. Oh well. It half-works. You just have to scroll down a bit. ~If you want, check it out [here](/joel/lifestream)~.
