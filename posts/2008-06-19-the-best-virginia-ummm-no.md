We drove from Greenville to Hurricane yesterday afternoon, and made it in around 9:30pm. The drive wasn't terrible - mostly because it was still light when we rolled up next to the Mini in the Hunts' driveway. We sat up talking for hours with Jessica's parents, which is our custom and managed to slip into our bed here around midnight.

We are hosting a barbecue tomorrow and have a bunch of friends coming over (hi [Lauren](http://laurensusanna.wordpress.com)!). I am probably most excited for this. Because I get to cook. And also it's nice to have a vacation where we can see people we know and love.

I'll be uploading photos to flickr this weekend, chronicling our adventure here.
