I was give a project on Friday (that is a blog for a certain thing) that's sort of a secret, and they want it done for tomorrow. I think I made some good headway on it. I'll post a link and/or a screenshot tomorrow or as soon as it's public.

I'm not super happy with what I had to do to get it to work, but it was late notice and not much time. So, if it works, it works. I may work on updating it and getting to work in an not-so-fake sort of way. I got it mostly working in my lame way. But I'm not content. Anyway, hopefully I can get it done.
