This is a great video made by Marc Webb, the director of (500) Days of Summer, and features Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It was premiered in [USA Today today](http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-08-04-zooey-joe-music-video_N.htm).

The song is *Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?* by She & Him (the brainchild project of M. Ward and Zooey Deschanel). You should really pick up the album if you haven't yet.
