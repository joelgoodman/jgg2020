I finished with the "goodest" of the AgapeFest photos I took. I'm happy with most of them. I even posted some to [JPG Magazine](http://www.jpgmag.com).

In any case, I'm going to look around this hard drive and add a few older ones just to give my photostream some variety.

Oh also, nifty tooltips on this blog now. Thanks to [Nice Tooltips](http://bueltge.de/wp-bubble-tooltips-plugin/142/) (German). They slowed the load down too much. I quit them.
