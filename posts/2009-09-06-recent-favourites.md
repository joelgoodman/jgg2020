I haven't written about any recent favourites lately, and I have a few new ones. So. Here we go.

- Arctic Monkeys - Humbug
An excellent record from Arctic Monkeys. It's a bit moodier than their previous offerings and a bit more chill.
- Green Curry
Not exactly a *new* favourite, but I've been eating it a lot the last couple days.
- Teaching
I love it. I could definitely see myself going into teaching as a primary career at some point. As long as the teaching was along the lines of web design and new media marketing. Maybe after I've got that MA I'm jonesing after. I think ideally I'd like to teach college and do freelance. And that's all.
- Winston Churchill
Again, not exactly a new favourite, but I'm hoping to read a lot more about him and his life in the coming months. The HBO movies [*The Gathering Storm*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314097/)and [*Into the Storm*](http://www.imdb.com/find?s=tt&amp;q=Into+the+Storm) are excellent.

It's September now and that means my birthday is coming up. I will be 25 years old. For some reason that has been resting heavily on my mind the last couple of weeks. It's almost as if I feel like I will actually be a real adult. As if I've been playing the grown up game the last four years or so.

And with that feeling the ever-present urge to move on someplace resurfaces with resounding gusto. I don't want to feel like I've wasted my young life in this small town. I want to go and do something different. Even at 25 the notion that life is short has hit me hard and I don't want to sit idly by watching the years pass as I feel like I've done the past nearly three years. Perhaps I need to make things happen. Or perhaps I need to wait and see if any of my leads pan out. I've always had a hard time with patience.

Only time will tell.
