But stuff hasn't slowed down yet.

I'm hoping to do a write-up of my time at [#heweb11](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23heweb11) later today or tomorrow, but here's my laundry list of things to-do first:

1. Catch up on Discourse Analysis schoolwork done
2. Figure out the stupid mess The New School put me in for my thesis (and if I can still do it) done
3. Read 2 articles for said thesis done
4. Do revisions for said thesis done
5. Work on two Dept. 3 websites done
6. Work on a site for another person
7. ???
8. Profit

I'll say this - it was a great time. If you want to see how great, I recommend looking through the [#heweb11](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23heweb11) hashtag on Twitter.

A lot of exciting things are happening.
