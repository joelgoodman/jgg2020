...and there is so much I need (and want) to get accomplished by Monday morning. First off, I need to novel like a mad man. I am WAY behind. Just over 50% and only about 10 days left till the end. I'm not sure I'll have time, but perhaps over Thanksgiving weekend.

We're going to try and get the floors in the front room finished so we can start some Christmas decorating. We would be able to put the tree up in any case. At the same time, I would like to get all of the trim up in the library. We did a door and a window last weekend but still have baseboards, wainscot and crown moulding to do. There isn't much floor left, so hopefully we can do both. (I think Micah is still coming over to help out)

I need to make steak & Guiness pie. It's cold enough and sounds soooo good. We've been craving it this last week. But I do need to novel. Both of us do.

We're staying home for the actual holiday. It's too long of a drive to WV to do Christmas *and* Thanksgiving, so we're giving it a miss this year and doing Cornish hens at home. It'll be nice. We need a proper break anyway. There was the thought of going to my aunt's house in Alabama, but that drive is just as far as Hurrican, WV. So that's out too.

Over Thanksgiving we have a few projects planned:

We need to decorate the house for Christmas. I'm not doing lights outside because our house is too awkward. For one, I don't have a tall enough ladder to get where I need to to fix the lights to the outside of the house. Secondly, the only outdoor power outlet is at the back of the house. I'm not sure why they didn't put one anywhere else, but thems the breaks. So no lights outside. It's nice to have a fake tree when our stationary status is so volatile. The easier, the better I say.

We are planning to just watch a ton of Christmas movies that weekend as well while we finish our novels.

So. Busy I am. For certain.
