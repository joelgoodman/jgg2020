Illinois keeps showing me why it's a lowsy state to live in. A few things I hate about Illinois:

- **Gas tax.** Illinois has one of the highest gas taxes in the Midwest. If I drive 45 minutes West to St Louis, gas is 20Â¢ cheaper than anyplace here in Illinois. Also, during the gas price climb Chicago consistently had the highest (or was in the top three) fuel prices in the country. Yes, even higher than California.
- **Energy rates.** Are freaking high in Illinois. In the winter we pay SO much for gas. When we were keeping the house at 65 degrees (Fahrenheit) we would still get charged close to $400/month. Outrageous considering we were cold the entire winter.
- **Corn Fields.** That is all we have here. Not really Illinois's fault that we decided to live here, but I don't like it anyway.
- **Governor Blagojevich.** He's a terrible governor. Just ask any resident. He lives in Chicago and takes his personal jet, no doubt using our tax dollars, to fly down to Springfield (the actual capitol) every day. Cha-ching!
- **Barack Obama.** Rhetoric, fantastical idealism and denial of reality. Not to mention his blind followers that don't realise their support will drive our nation into the ground and bring war to our shores.

And just today I realised our auto insurance rates increased. I called up Nationwide to find out what was up (because we haven't had any accidents or anything) and the CSR told me that our state rates had gone up. To the tune of $10 more a month. Which sucks. Not only do we have to pay some of the highest gas prices in the nation, we now have to pay more in car insurance.

I am ready to leave Illinois. This state is not cool enough to act like it's California. I'm ready to go someplace that has a culture and ruling body that warrants it's irratic pricing behaviours.

Screw Illinois. I'm leaving in a year.
