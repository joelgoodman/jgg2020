We went and saw Brideshead Revisited today at Plaza Frontenac. It was really moving. I'm not exactly sure why I connected with it so strongly, but it definitely stirred something inside me.

As a film, the cinematography was beautiful, the acting impeccable and the script witty and poignant. I really really liked it. But it was sad. Really sad. But not in the normal ways. I think you should see it.
