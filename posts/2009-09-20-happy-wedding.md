Sam and Melissa's wedding was great yesterday. It was awesome to see so many people from school that I hadn't seen in awhile and also to share with Sam and Mel on their day. Sam was in our wedding and he was nice enough to include me in his as an usher.

I met a couple of his friends I hadn't met before as well as reacquainting myself with some that I had. The guys all had a lot of fun and got along great.

Jess and I realized that there really wasn't any need for us to stay in Springfield. It was only an hour and a half drive (for some reason I was thinking it would be closer to two or two and a half hours there) and we easily could've driven back home after the rehearsal dinner on Friday and driven back up on Saturday for the ceremony. But it all worked out alright.

I think Sam and Mel had a good day and we may be meeting up with them for my birthday on Tuesday. Overall it was a great weekend.
