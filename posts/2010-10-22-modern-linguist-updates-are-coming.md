I will be making some updates to my *[Modern Linguist](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/2009/10/30/modern-linguist/)* theme for WordPress for this year's [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org). It'll be released before November 1st and will include a couple of new features:

- Google CDN font embedding (Google Fonts)
- Cleaner code (I've learned a bunch in the past year)
- WordPress 3 updates
- Some fixed up CSS styles w/ a bit more CSS3

An announcement will be forthcoming. If you have specific requests, leave them in the comments and I will see what I can do.
