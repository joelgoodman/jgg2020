Last night I did something crazy. I committed myself a grueling, month-long excursion into authoring an entire novel in one month. November is National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) and I will be joining the thousands around the world participating in this crazy write-off. The goal is a 50,000 word novel, from scratch, in a month. But I think I can do it.

[![](http://www.nanowrimo.org/files/main/images/nanowrimo_participant_icon_122x244.gif)](http://www.nanowrimo.org)[NaNoWriMo.org](http://www.nanowrimo.org) sponsors the event and has a little community going on on their site during the month of November. Jessica is going to be joining me in this quest. I'm really thankful for that. I am not sure I could make it through writing fiction every day for 30 days without some help and motivation.

There's still time to sign up if this sounds like something you'd like to do. If you decide to, let me know here and we can be "writing buddies" and hopefully get through this huge challenge. I am really excited for it as writing a novel is something I've started and stopped several times over the last couple of years. This time, I'm going to finish.

I'm just guessing here, but I would expect my blogging to slow down a bit, though I will try to post excerpts from what I'm writing--that aren't complete trash--to this blog. And if you are going to be writing for this, I'd love to give you a link in my blogroll and follow along with what you're doing.

If you've stumbled here and are already a participant and need a writing buddy, click [here](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/439200) to go to my NaNoWriMo author profile.

The writing starts tomorrow! I'm excited, nervous and a little intimidated. But let's do it!
