I'm loving 2013 so far. There's lots of great stuff already happening and even more to come! One of the big things on the horizon is the release of *Social Works*, edited by Michael Stoner ( @mStonerblog ) and containing a smattering of case studies from Higher Ed professionals.

> *Social Works: How #HigherEd Uses #SocialMedia to Raise Money, Build Awareness, Recruit Students and Get Results* is the **only** book that explores how colleges and universities around the world have used social media in successful campaigns. It contains 25 case studies of campaigns from 27 institutions, written by 18 contributors and has a lengthy chapter on how to develop a successful campaign.

I'm super excited to have a case study included in this collection among so many brilliant marketers in the higher education field. Make sure you head over to the [announcement post](http://www.mstoner.com/blog/social-media/social-works-coming-to-bookshelves-and-ereaders-on-25-february/) for more info. And, I'm sure I'll be tweeting and posting news as more is released.

Remember, 25 February 2013!
