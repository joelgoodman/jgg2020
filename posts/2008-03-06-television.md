Tonight is LOST. I love LOST. Is that crazy? No way. I am super-excited about it. We generally get together with Andr√©, Liz and Katie. It's a great time, because we all love it.

Once The Office is back on we'll start up our Office parties again. Top Chef is coming back next week, I think. That's a great show.

I had a great idea for a WordPress plugin, but I'm crap at php. I would love a plugin that takes the time of post-- the_time( ) -- and checks it against the last song you scrobbled then inserts a span class that inserts the artist and track name along with a picture of the band/album. So in effect it functions as an automatic way to insert the song you were listening at time of post. Like Xanga, but automatic.

Too bad I don't know much. Maybe if I ever decide to get into php I'll do something like that.
