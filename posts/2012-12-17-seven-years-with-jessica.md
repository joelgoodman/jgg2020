Today marks seven years of marriage to the most fun, caring woman I've ever known. [Jessica](http://waysideviolet.com) and I have celebrated our anniversaries in California, Greenville, West Virginia, St Louis, Chicago, Williamsburg, and now Austin. It's been an exciting, challenging, and entirely worthwhile seven years. I feel so privileged to have found her and that she continues to put up with me on days that I'm lazy or tired or overworked or not as thoughtful as I should be. She really is an incredible person and the best possible friend I could ever have. I love you, Jessica!

Apparently we didn't take pictures before 2008... We spent 2007 in California and had a really weird experience at a Benihana in Ontario. Our first anniversary, in 2006, we were living with Jessica's parents and we went to a really good Italian restaurant in Charleston, WV that has since closed down.
