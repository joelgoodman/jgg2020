Okay, maybe not exactly. Battle of the Bands was this morning. We actually had some great groups out to play. One of the bands from Indianapolis came in first place for this round; they are called Farebridge. They were pretty cool. Girl singer, synths, great stage presence and really nice kids.

It was the best BoB we've had so far - at least in the six years I've worked with the festival. One campus band, Hot Fever, was awesome too. They're one to check out.

Tonight, Jessica and I have tickets to see Feist atÂ [The Pageant](http://www.thepageant.com) in STL. I'm pretty excited, it should be a great show. And the venue is excellent. I don't think I've been to the Pageant since I saw Ryan Adams there my Junior year of college. Plus, I don't know anyone else going, which is great (at least for this show). What kind of sucks is that The Pragmatic is opening for Dan Deacon in a free show tonight as well, so I have to pass that up. But Feist will probably be better.
