Seriously. Go download their new mixtape from Amazon here: [http://tinyurl.com/65umem](http://tinyurl.com/65umem)

[![P is for Panda!](http://pisforpanda.com/contentjoel.thegoodmanblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/mixtapecover2-300x299.jpg)](http://pisforpanda.com/content/we-are-losing-it/)It's amazing. And totally worth a free download. They also are offering the Mike Dunn & the Kings of New England EP for free at their site. I bought the EP last summer and it's really really good. Panda will be releasing their full length soon.

Go download the Mixtape!
