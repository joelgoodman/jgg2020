Anyone else notice the idiotic Mac v. PC flame wars going on again? I don't want to add to it--in fact, I didn't even want to pay notice to it at all. But people are dumb and I'm tired of them being so.

Disclaimer: I'm a Mac user. But I'm sure you knew that.

I must say though, Windows 7 is looking mighty nice. I'm excited to play with the next release candidate. But will it make me switch back to a Windows PC? Probably not. I've chosen my plight in life and I'm much more content now, using OS X on my MacBook Pro, than I ever was using a PC.

In high school and first three years of college I was a total PC guy. I built computers quite often, went down the computer fair in Pomona, CA, overclocked... all of it. Even dual booted Linux a few times, trying to get used to Slackware and Dropline. I did a lot of open source, used various shells (I loved blackbox for a while), blah blah blah. I was a PC nerd.

But I always liked Macs. Junior year of high school was my first significant introduction with the platform. I had a video editing internship at the local megachurch and we used a Media-100 editing rig with a PowerMac. At school, in computer graphics class, we had the first and second series of iMacs to do editing, photoshopping, etc. on. And I loved them. In fact, the more I used those Macs, the more I liked them. Especially after OS X released.

When I worked at a camp we did our video editing on a PowerMac as well, in Final Cut Pro 2 (horrible software!). So I used the tool fit for the jobs. I built my desktop PCs, but after working at our college's IT Helpdesk on so many Dell laptops I quickly decided that I wouldn't by a name-brand Windows-based laptop. Too many problems with them. But I've had minimal problems with my Macs.

So the point: Stop Hating! It's a computer. Just because someone has a different preference than you doesn't make it bad. Macs are not inherently better than PCs or vice versa. Macs are better for me and the way I use a computer in the same way the Windows PCs are better for some programmers. Design-wise, Apples locked that objectively. But if you don't care about design or UI, it doesn't matter.

This isn't 1997. The flame wars are done. No matter how much Microsoft or Apple are trying to make you believe they aren't, the simple fact is that it doesn't matter. You buy and use what you buy and use, and you are not obligated to justify it.
