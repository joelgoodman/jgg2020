...but it scared me too much not to. Or maybe it just made me sick. I'm not sure which. If you've seen the incredible German film [*Good Bye Lenin!*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/) and have done any reading from the WWII era or into the cultural and political climate in Europe countries post-WWII and through the Cold War (pre-Berlin Wall falling) this might strike you similarly.

But it certainly didn't rest easy with me. Even if this had been made for John McCain I would shun it, because it seems like an exploitation of children to me, as well as minor deity glorification or idolatry.

There was a [response](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAkc03uHmeU) (which I didn't watch until after I saw the original) that puts it into (albeit right-leaning biased) perspective. Regardless, that really does rub me the wrong way.
