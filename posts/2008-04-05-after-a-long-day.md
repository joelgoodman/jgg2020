Jess and I got a ton done outside of our house today, but not as much as I would've liked to inside. I am glad to be sitting here on our couch watching the British House of Commons that we DVR (yeah, I am really that obsessed with England), and cruising around the interweb tubes.

Doc J posted something on net4mac, an application-based, mac-only social network. It's kind of cool. Not cool enough for me to post a link here, but if you want to find it, feel free. It's neat.

I'm having issues with the gallery feature here in 2.5 - I kind of hate it. I wrestled for hours yesterday trying to get it to do what I want. Matt Mullenweg, who created and develops WordPress, has a sweet set up over at his blog, but I can't seem to replicate what he's done. I'm hoping in future versions (or in plugins) there'll be options in the administration, at the very least. That's really the only problem I've encountered in 2.5, and it's a shame because it's got a lot of promise. I'm just not sure it was implemented very well. It just doesn't behave how one would expect.

We're going to church with Liz and Andr√© tomorrow, so that should be fun. Then, tomorrow afternoon, I'll be working on the WGRN site.

Well... that's all I've got. I think I'll go to bed.

Cheers.
