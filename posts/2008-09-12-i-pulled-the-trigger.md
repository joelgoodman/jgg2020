And I sent my application off to Syracuse. Now I am PRAYING that I get in. My GPA was lower than I remembered it being, but hopefully it's alright. That stupid first year of music classes really killed me. I should've been DM and MP. Oh well.

I should hear back in a few weeks and if all goes well we'll be heading to New York next summer and I'll start studying Documentary Film and History!

It makes me SO excited. I really hope I get in. If you pray, I'd appreciate a prayer for this!

p.s. I also ordered a Holga yesterday. Should be here next week. Yay!
