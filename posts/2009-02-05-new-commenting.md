Just thought I'd let you, my readership (hah!), know that I dropped the IntenseDebate commenting for the built-in threaded commenting they put in WordPress 2.7.

Anyway. Lemme know if you see anything that doesn't work. I think it's styled alright, though I might mess with it a bit more later.

We'll be in WV this weekend for my father-in-law's 50th birthday. Luckily, someone's staying at the house with our dog. So, it'll be a good weekend. Anyway.
