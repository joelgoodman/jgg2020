...was just accepted into the Master of Arts in Media Studies program at [The New School](http://newschool.edu/mediastudies)!

I'm pretty freaking excited about it.

I start the program in January and it's all online--unless we move to New York, but I don't see a ton of chance in that happening unless I get a new, well-paying job there.

Super excited!!! I am possibly co-teaching a New Media marketing online class next May term.

Busy times.
