My friend [André](http://www.theremixcompany.co.uk) got a cover story writeup in the RiverFront Times. [Read it](http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2008-03-12/news/e-mix-andr-eacute-anjos-and-the-remix-artist-collective-leverage-initiative-ingenuity-and-the-internet-into-an-online-music-force/)!

From the article:

> "The [Shins] liked it enough to release the song, "Sleeping Lessons," in April 2007 as the B-side of a UK single. It's actually one of the few tangible artifacts of Anjos' remixes. (Others include Tokyo Police Club's "Be Good" — which appeared on the Toronto spazz-pop wunderkinds' *Smith* EP — and a few seven-inch singles.) But a lack of physical product doesn't mean Anjos isn't making money. He doesn't earn royalties on his remixes, but he now commands $1,500 to $3,000 per track. Of course, he'll work at a discount if he can leverage that into access to industry contacts or the guarantee of future work. Like the smaller indie bands he remixes, Anjos understands that at this stage in his career any exposure is potentially valuable."
