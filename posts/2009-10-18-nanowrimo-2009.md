[![NaNoWriMo 2009](http://res.cloudinary.com/joelgoodman/image/upload/v1401314055/nano_09_blk_participant_120x901_png1__ot8yyf.png)](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/439200)NaNoWriMo: National Novel Writing Month.

That eleventh month of the year when tens of thousands of normal and not-so-normal men and women sit down for hours upon hours, pouring words out onto the page or screen with hopes that someday, somehow, a publishing deal may come along and give them boatloads of money... *sigh*

Just like last year, I will once again be attempting to race my way to a 50,000 word novel in only thirty days. I made it last year and am hoping to finish this year as well. If you are going to be participating, please head over to the NaNoWriMo website and [add me as a writing buddy](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/439200).

Last year I had some friends interested in reading my story. I decided to post new entries to my blog and shared it with them. I'm going to do the same this year (and hopefully actually finish the story instead of just getting to 50k words).

If you'd like to read along, [please register](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/wp-login.php?action=register). I reserve the right to refuse membership to anyone, however. So don't take it personally. I'll be closing registration on 01 November. So if you want to register, do it now.

For those of you that were readers last year, you don't need to re-register. You've already got an account. Just login (there's a link in the sidebar).

NaNoWriMo is AWESOME and you should really consider doing it. Head over to [NaNoWriMo.org](http://nanowrimo.org) and find out more about it.
