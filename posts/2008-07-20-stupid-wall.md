I was trying to bolt our pedestal sink into the wall today. Yeah, that didn't work. I guess I'll have to do what the plumber suggested, and that means disassembling the entire sink, cutting a hole in the wall and inserting cement board into that space.

That sucks. The anchors included with the sink just decided to rip through the drywall completely... which is what they're supposed to keep the fastening screws from doing. I guess that drywall is from like, 1973 or something... I wonder if that was part of it?
