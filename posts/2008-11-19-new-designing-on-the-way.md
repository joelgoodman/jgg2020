A college friend of mine IMed me this afternoon asking about my web design services. And it looks like I'm going to be helping him get a new blog up.

That's super exciting for me, as I have a lot more fun designing for other people than I do for myself. I've got a couple of ideas in mind and he's getting some stuff together, but I'm really excited to be working on this project for him.

I'll keep ya'll abrest of the situation when it starts going. I'm stoked.

And I'm also currently dumping a homemade cooking show from one of my colleagues. Weird. Super weird. Oh well.
