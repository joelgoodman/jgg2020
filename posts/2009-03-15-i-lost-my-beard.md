Okay, I didn't really lose it, but I did get rid of it unfortunately.

I participate in this weekly photo assignment with a group of Flickr friends and this week's topic was "Before and After". I did aÂ [faux-dyptic](http://www.flickr.com/photos/asilentthing/3358453138/) that ended up being half of my face (with a beard) and the other have sans-beard. I'm sad the beard is gone. And that means I've already started on a new one.

One of the participants in the group tried to console me in the comments, explaining my actions away as "performance art"--so I'll go with that. In any case... we like me better with a beard. I look like a baby without.
