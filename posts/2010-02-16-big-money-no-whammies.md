The movers are here, packing up our stuff. We're supposed to finalize a lease tonight or tomorrow. The first place we wanted fell through. We are hoping beyond hope and praying hard that this one will work out. We need it to.

Puppy is going to stay with Audra for a few days while we take care of things. I can't wait to be in our warm hotel room in Bannockburn tonight. Watching LOST. And relaxing a little. There have been a few hitches with this moving process, but I'm trying not to worry about stuff too much.

Tomorrow we're doing stuff at Trinity; Thursday we'll be moving in (as long as things go well); Friday we'll be driving to Champaign to pick up Cors; Saturday we'll have Jessica's parents visiting.

It's been a long couple of weeks.
