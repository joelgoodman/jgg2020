My Powerbook G4 is just getting old and slow. I realized this morning that I haven't even owned it for three years yet. I mean, it's fine for certain things like browsing the web, email, chat, music, watching videos and stuff... but CS3 is rough on it, even with just one app open. And a lot of times I need to run Photoshop and Dreamweaver at the same time. Photoshop itself takes about three minutes to start up (mainly due to my large font collection and all the brush sets I have).

Anyway. I am definitely holding off until the inevitable refresh (maybe around WWDC?). I need some time to save some money anyway. We just bought Jessica's last September. So. Yeah. Maybe I should put a donate button on the bottom of this site. Hm. Nah.
