Okay, not really. There this cool plugin I have integrated into my blog called [Last.fm RPS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lastfm-rps/) that shows my recently scrobbled songs. It's awesome.

Today, though, Last.fm's new design came out of beta and went live. This broke my site, a little. Probably that on top of GoDaddy's pretty dismal speeds anyway. Half of blog would load if you were lucky.

So anyway, that plugin is disabled until the author and Last.fm jump these hurdles.

That means if you want to know what I'm listening to (because I am so pretentious as to assume you care - you do right?), you'll have to check last.fm out. Click [here](http://www.last.fm/user/asilentthing/) for my profile.
