This morning Jessica and I went to church with Liz and Andr√©. It was... interesting. Really nice people, but the pastor was kind of "fun". He put that televangelist "uh" at the end of words, but only at the beginning of the service and during his closing prayer. Not during the sermon, or when he was talking to us. It was odd. Everyone there seemed really genuine though, and that's a breath of fresh air.

I got to barbeque today too. The first of the season! Pretty much whatever meat was in our freezer, brats, pineapple, peppers and nectarines. It was good.

Finally got to work on the WGRN site. Here's a mockup:

The previous design was horrible. But I am actually pretty happy with this. I'll be coding it this week and next weekend. Except that saturday will get in the way - we're going to see Feist at the Pageant that night. Unfortunately that concert is at the same time as the [Pragmatic](http://www.myspace.com/thepragmatic) opening for Dan Deacon. Oh well.

Hopefully I've got a full week ahead of me. I'm tired of sitting around waiting for certain servers to work. So we'll see what we can do.

Leave your suggestions/impressions on that design for WGRN. I'd appreciate any insights.
