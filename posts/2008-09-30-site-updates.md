There are some changes here and I'm really excited that they're done!

You'll notice that there are no more photos in the sidebar. Until the flickr plugin I use can handle multiple instances, those will be gone from the sidebar. You'll also notice some new styling on my last.fm sidebar widget. That makes me happy. I think it looks better.

So where did the photos go? On the [photography](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/photography/) page of course. And it's set up mighty fine if I do say so myself. So go check it out. Let me know what you think. And if you're on flickr, add me as a contact sometime! There's a link on the page.
