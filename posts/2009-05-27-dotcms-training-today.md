This morning I'll be training about 19 faculty and staff members at the college to use our new CMS platform. I'm surprised to have garnered such a great number of people.

Kevin and Lance will be helping me do the training. We're going to go over the interface and how to contribute content to dotCMS. Should be tons of fun.

Hurrah?
