Tomorrow is CSS Naked Day. The 3rd one, in fact. I'm not exactly sure how this site will look - I've got an idea, but I really can't remember how much I hacked the template install and where certain images are... I think most are in the CSS.

Anyway, this blog will be hyper-minimal and ugly tomorrow. For the day. But I wanted to give a heads-up in case anyone sees this.
