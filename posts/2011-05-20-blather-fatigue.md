blather |ˈblaðər *noun*
	long-winded talk with no real substance.

As I sit and watch the tweets roll by in my Twitter client I am frustrated–and today especially, for some reason–by the lack of substance. Don't get me wrong, I love Twitter. I love it for the relationships I've made and maintained and the [community that it builds](/posts/the-anti-facebook/). I am totally sick, on the other hand, of the lack of new thought in my field.

I work in higher education web marketing. That basically means I am an over-worked, under-paid marketer who makes the best of what the underfunded school can provide. I am okay with that and have been for the past five years.

What I am not okay with is how easily we lose the human aspect of what we do. Eventually we all start talking like professional marketing salespeople, blathering on about the latest social media tool, hitting all the major buzzwords. It's gotten to the point where I flush with near-disgust when I see people saying the same things they have for the past three years; when conference topics show that we still don't seem to get the very context we're living in.

It makes me want to run. It makes me really glad for the academic work I've been doing, knowing that I'll be working to shape and understand the thought behind the ways media affect humans. If not to help people out, definitely to stop the cacophonous drone of the same old, same old.

After last year's #heweb10 [I wrote a post](/posts/state-of-highedweb/) on how I was disappointed with most of the conference session topics because they seemed so obvious. I really thought that over the last year we as an industry were getting past a lot of that. And I think there have been some good strides... but we're just so reluctant to really *be* the visionaries that we so desperately need. And I don't know why that is.

I hope I never turn stagnant. I want to be a true thought-leader, not a famous thought-regurgitator.
