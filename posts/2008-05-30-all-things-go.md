Sometimes I just get stressed out with life. But I'm okay. Finances suck sometimes. Not that I have problems; I just worry easily.

Adding to my summer listening list: [Mike Dunn & the Kings of New England](http://www.amazon.com/The-Edge-of-America-E-P/dp/B0013SHXC6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1212200183&amp;sr=8-3)

[Randall](http://randallpauljenkins.com/) (actually Chad via Randall, I guess) recommended it, and it is FANTASTIC. I can't tell you how stoked I was toward the end of my internship that the guys I looked up to at Militia loved Limbeck. When Chad passed on to me one of the Light Wires albums... oh man. So, Chad and Randall - thank you for the great music recommendations. Click that link up there and download it. The EP is less than $6 and totally worth that. This might be one of my favorite records for this summer (but it's too early to tell yet).

I've been connecting with a lot of people I knew years ago on Facebook the last couple days. It's been awesome. That's one of the things I love about the social internet - being able to reconnect. That's something that just wouldn't happen without the tubes and interwebs.

Jess and I took some photos today that I'm pretty happy with. I'm looking for more gear to possibly take with us to Europe in July. Maybe a Kiev-4 or a Holga. I think I'm shying away from Holga because they're common with the people I know. But we'll see what happens.

Also, I'm reading a new book. Well, it's kind of an old book, but it's one my Britannia-centric friends (ahem, Randall) would enjoy. It's called *[Outposts: Journey to the Surviving Relics of the British Empire](http://www.amazon.com/Outposts-Journeys-Surviving-Relics-British/dp/0060598611/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1212200806&amp;sr=1-1)*Â and it's a travel book... sort of. It's a guy's retelling of his attempt to visit every remaining outpost of Imperial Britain. I'm not too far in yet, but it's already got me excited. I can't wait to really get into it.

I'm also looking at some new Masters programs on the East coast. Stepping stones, if you will, to get to my final choice of MA/Ph.D. at William and Mary. Still working out the strategy in it all, but I think I've got it pretty airtight and will be brushing up for a GRE re-take and then applying to Syracuse University (possibly).

Restlessness kicks in about now. The campus is empty and I'm stuck doing web work. And not very creative web work at that. Hopefully my summer trips will keep me sane.
