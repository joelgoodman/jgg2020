that GRE prep is kicking my butt. I wish I had kept myself in practice for the Quantitative (read: math) parts of the test. Hopefully I can get some strategies out of all this.

If you pray, please add me to the list. I need a good GRE score because I need to go to grad school next summer, because I need to get out of Greenville.

Thank you.
