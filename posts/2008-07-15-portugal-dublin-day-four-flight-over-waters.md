We woke from a pretty decent night's sleep at the Holiday Inn Lisbon and were out the door, down to the taxi stop outside the hotel. After paying driver, the three of us crossed through the doors into Lisbon Airport and entered a different world. The airport is hard to explain beyond "chaos". It was ridiculous. The sheer number of people trying any number of ways to find the desk to check in. Signs pointing everywhere. The most disorganized airport I had ever seen.

We stood in a single-file straight line for about 25 minutes, checked our bags with Aer Lingus and took off to find our gate. Again, confusing and hard to deal with. Except I must say, security checkpoints in Europe are so intelligent. You would think that European airlines would have more incidents than the US since European checkpoints don't make you remove your shoes like TSA does... but they don't. And I'm glad I got to keep my shoes on.

We got breakfast at the only little place past the International passport check. Jon had a mista (like we had the previous morning in Esmoriz) while Jess and I had pastries, coffee and nectar. Then we started the waiting game at our gate. Luckily our flight was only going to be an hour and a half. We chatted and noticed the number of Americans around us. There was a Continental flight to Newark the next gate down and the layout of the terminal meant everyone was crammed together.

We boarded our flight and got seated. Jess and I had a Portuguese guy next to us who seem really upset--the flight was delayed a little, so I wonder if that caused it. He kept checking his watch and his mobile. Once in the air I was able to doze for a few minutes, but then an older lady in the seat in front of us started having health problems.

It got so bad that the flight crew had to ask for a doctor on board and we eventually ended up landing in Spain, in Santiago. Paramedics came and rushed her out of the plane and into an ambulance where they could check her out. We sat for 45 minutes. Waiting.

The paramedic crew finally brought her back on board and she ended up sitting at the back of the craft with a nurse who had just so happened to be on board this flight. As we took off again they notified us it would still be another two and a half hours. That's a LONG flight. So in all, LIS to DUB took us about five hours when it was supposed to take two and half.

We finally landed in Dublin and went to get our bags, exchange money and call our B&B to let them know we had gotten in late. We also bought five day bus passes to use while we were there. Those turned out to be a great deal.

We went out front and found out which bus to take and boarded it. The bus ride was only about 20 minutes or so. But when we stepped out onto the sidewalk, we were faced with the task of finding the place. A local guy walking down the street, coffee in one hand and Curly Wurly in the other, helped us find it and we were there.

Since our flight was so late the proprietors were gone and we were greeted by their sister. She showed us to our room where we dumped our stuff. Then we took off to find some food. A short walk later and we were seated at The Ivy House ordering food and passing my iPod around so we could check email and update Twitter and Facebook.

After eating a delicious vegetable curry (Jess had a salad and Jon had fish and chips) we headed back, stopping at a SPAR for mint Aero bars and Curly Wurlys. Jess and I made tea in our room and got hot showers. We also watched some TV, since it was in English. Then we slept. Full Irish Breakfast was promised in the morning.
