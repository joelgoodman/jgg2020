Terribly excited that my awesome and beautiful wife, [Jessica](http://waysideviolet.com), got her acceptance letter into grad school today! She's going to start a Master of Fine Arts at [Academy of Art University](http://www.academyart.edu/) this fall semester. Her program is in Fashion Design: Knitwear, and she is super-excited to start. I'm really proud of her!
