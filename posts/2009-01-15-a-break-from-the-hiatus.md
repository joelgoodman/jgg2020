Wow. Sorry for the lack of posts. A ton is going on at work. And at night, well Jess and I have been burning through the *How I Met Your Mother* DVDs. Hilarious show. I highly recommend it.

So what else has been going on? Well, we're rolling on our dotCMS project at work. We're in the design stages, which is fantastic, and I'm acting as project manager. Kevin started work on Monday and is getting into the swing of stuff. We're going to have a lot of fun with this as it moves.

I've been working on a site design for my friend Chris. I'm hoping to start slicing and markup by this weekend at the latest. I would like to have his blog rolled out by the middle of February, and once the designs are done, the actual coding shouldn't take too horribly long. I'm pretty proud of it too, it's pretty cool, if I do say so myself. Here's a [sample](http://www.whatisawix.com).

Implementing some new stuff over at AgapeFest.com. New videoBlog up, a deal with Sonicbids, some other stuff. It's going good.

I'm reading this incredible book called [*The Meaning of Night*](http://readernaut.com/books/15300/the-meaning-of-night/). It's incredible and complicated, so it'd take a lot to explain it. Hit up Amazon and read the summary. It's so good.

Jess is finally reading [*Eats, Shoots and Leaves*](http://readernaut.com/joelgoodman/books/1592402038/eats-shoots-leaves/) and thinks it is great, just as I predicted she would.

It is super cold here this morning. -2ÂºF. And my office is drafty.
