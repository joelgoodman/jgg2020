I realise that since I am not an Obama supporter this is dangerous. More likely, the stories linked below will fall on deaf and fantastically idealistic ears, enraging, or at least generating, a frustrated perception of... me. But in our nearly one-sided political climate in America, I think it's important to get as many perspectives on our presidential candidates. That said, if you find any interesting links to stories on McCain or Clinton or whoever else, put them in the comments so I can take a gander.

A friend passed along this link from the [*Asia Times*](http://www.atimes.com/). It's a really interesting article, if a little bit long, and provides a perspective I had not yet encountered. Take a read if you care to:

[Obama's women reveal his secret](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/JB26Aa01.html)

Linked from that piece is one from January, just after Obama won the South Carolina primary, and concerns the US economic crisis. Another interesting read:
