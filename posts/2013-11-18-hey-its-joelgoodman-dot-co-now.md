So there was this one time, back in the day, when there was no such thing as a .co domain. And there's this (pretty awesome) film score composer in Los Angeles with whom I share a name. And because he's sort of famous and a bit older than me, he totally grabbed joelgoodman.com before I could even register a domain. In those days I thought I'd be clever and grab thegoodmanblog.com and add my name as a subdomain. And it was good.

But today it finally clicked... I could probably grab joelgoodman.co and get the TLD name I always wanted, but more awesome because it's a .co.

And so it was done. And so my site is now at [http://joelgoodman.co](http://joelgoodman.co) ... And now you know.

Now back to your regularly scheduled Twitters.
