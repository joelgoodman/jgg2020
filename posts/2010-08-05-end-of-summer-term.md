Wow. Tomorrow is the last day of my summer term at The New School and I am **worn out**. I've had two semi-intense projects this week and they are due today or tomorrow.

One is a mobile site for micro narratives and will launch tonight (after I get the normal browser site styled up). The second is a database of the self which I still have to create a WordPress template for. But the idea is simple, so it shouldn't take too long.

I'm also in the process of get CS5 Master Collection installed on my work MacBook Pro. I'm kind of excited to jump in and work with it.

On top of that, I am REALLY looking forward to a weekend with no school. I need to catch up on some of this lost sleep, as well as work on a couple of projects.
