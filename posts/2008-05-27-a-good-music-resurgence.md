I feel like there's a lot of really good music coming out lately. It's been a while. Those last three years of college were pretty stagnant on the new good music front. But I've been pretty happy lately.

I'll be checking out the new Weezer tomorrow... though it hasn't been released yet...

Any other recommendations?

Also, the European Cup is getting close. And we'll be in Dublin and Portugal during the Cup... FUN.
