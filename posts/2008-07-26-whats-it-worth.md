Jess and I are waiting for the appraiser to call. She's going to come out, snap some photos and then we'll hear back. Or my parents will.

It's kind of exciting... at least for me. We'll get some kind of idea as to what the work we've put in has been worth. Even though we're not finished yet, it'll be nice encouragement for me.

After she's gone I'm going to fix up our half bath's door and replace the drywall, prime and paint. After that I should be able to start laying floors. And then our house will look beautiful!

I just wish the appraiser would call...
