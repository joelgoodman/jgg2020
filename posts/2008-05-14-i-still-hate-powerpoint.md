I've spent the last three days working in PowerPoint on three separate presentations for Commencement. No, not because I'm slow in PPT, but because the offices that commissioned this project had problems getting me the information I needed.

In any case, I hate how anti-intuitive the program is in Mac Office 2008. We should all just use Keynote for these types of things. It's better looking anyway. And easy to use.

Anyway. I envy those of you that never have to look at PowerPoint. Given, for me it comes but once a year. But that one time a year is enough to make me hurl. Figuratively.
