I signed up for a Flickr Pro account today. I realized I only had 58mb of upload space left this month... so I upgraded. I'm planning on taking tons of photos and for $25 it's a good deal.

My new lenses got here yesterday and I got to play with them last night a bit. I'm pretty impressed. The quality Tamron put into the lenses if great. They feel nice. Not like the Nikon battery grip I bought that feels really cheap.

The hyacinths have been blooming on the side of our house; I didn't even know we had hyacinths on our property. But they're beautiful. We've also got daffodils from the next door neighbors (I'm pretty sure that's the case) and day lilies on the other side of the house. It's great to have stuff blooming! Of course, it is supposed to snow tomorrow. Stupid Illinois weather.
