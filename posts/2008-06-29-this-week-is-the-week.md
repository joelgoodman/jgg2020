Jon's leaving tomorrow. We will follow on Thursday. I am ecstatic about our trip to Portugal. We're even making it in in time for André's bachelor party. And we'll get to see a good bit of the area.

I do wish we could stay longer than a few days. We're taking a train from Porto to Lisbon on Sunday and then flying to Dublin on Monday morning. So we'll have the evening in Lisbon to get some food and hang out. The train ride will be nice too. Three hours and I'm sure some pretty good scenery. And the food in Portugal will be fantastic.

I talked to Danny yesterday on our way to see a movie (Wanted. Horrible film. Don't see it. It sucked big time). We're gonna try to do a three-week Ireland trip with him sometime. I've got a few good itineraries that I've found.

In any case. Foreign travel is beckoning. I'll be photoblogging as long as I can find a wifi connection (which should be at our B&B)

If you want to see our trip itinerary, go over to [tripit.com](http://www.tripit.com/people/joelgoodman) and sign-up (add me as a contact too!). If you have some ideas or insight into what we should see or do in Dublin, Porto or Lisbon - leave it in the comments.
