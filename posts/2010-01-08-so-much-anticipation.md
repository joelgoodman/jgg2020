Wednesday afternoon I had a phone interview with Gary Cantwell at [Trinity International University](http://www.tiu.edu) (TIU) about a Web Marketing Manager position they have opened at the school. I think the interview went well, and I really want this job.

My work at Greenville College has been stressful since this past summer when the school fired our Web Developer. Hard economic times have hit Higher Education, and that is all too apparent at GC. Since August I have been responsible for at least four websites. My responsibilities have included both technical and non-technical and also require that I work with people across campus. I am the ONLY person supporting the websites.

I also have to work under extremely demanding conditions and am the one that gets blamed when things break or aren't exactly right. Lately it seems I am at the whim of anyone who needs anything. And I do everything from design to programming to training to phone support. The only thing I don't do right now is marketing.

And that is my biggest issue. I was hired at GC as the Assistant Director of Public Relations before moving into a role as Web Content Coordinator. My job description was about marketing on the web. Writing copy, rewriting copy, managing social networks and the like. But once the VP over our department left and my supervisor was fired, I was immediately moved to doing only technical work.

I don't consider myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do have enough knowledge to muddle through some basic scripting. My passions and interests, however, lie in marketing online, making brands, and developing relationships with users/customers/clients/etc. You can imagine why I am unhappy. I am forced to be all things to all people except for the one thing I want to be.

The position at TIU is a dream for me. The school is located north of Chicago, there are opportunities for Jessica to get a real job, AND the job description matches exactly what I want to do and what I am skilled at. Plus, the people seem awesome.

So now I am sitting in our hotel room in Portland, waiting for my sister's wedding rehearsal to start. My Mac is clean (because the partition was corrupted and I had to reinstall OS X) and my hands are cold. I can feel a little anxiety in the back of my mind, peeking through and trying to take over. I can't stand the thought of going back to the job I loathe in only two days.

But maybe, just maybe I will get a call from Gary on Monday or Tuesday. And that call will invite me up to Trinity to interview face-to-face. Maybe they will offer me the job. And then this anxiety will be gone. Then Jessica and I can face something new and exciting and refreshing.

And perhaps the stagnation I feel in Greenville will lift and we can start a new kind of life. I sure hope so. And every prayer of mine has been in that direction.

The truth of the matter is that I need to give my worry to God and trust that whatever is best for us will happen. I really hope Chicago and Trinity are the best things for us.
