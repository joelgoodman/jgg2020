I realize that there is still about a month left of summer for me, but I feel like it's about time I start getting back into the routine of schoolwork and thinking about my thesis. At the end of August I'll be starting my last credits in my MA and that's kind of exciting. Only nine credit hours remain in my degree, but they will need to be completed over the course of two semesters, leaving a lot of time for thesis preparation and writing.

I think I am pretty fortunate to be working with the two advisors I have. They are media scholars whom I look up to and have learned a lot from in the courses I've taken under them. Their international perspectives will really help me stay extra-America in my thought processes, and in greater ways than I think any of the full-time principal faculty at The New School is able to. I've found that a lot of New Yorkers are really New York-centric in their thought... and I need be thinking globally.

So. Now that we've caught up on Doctor Who, and Top Gear is winding down the summer series, and there's not much else to distract me, I think it's time to start reading. A lot. I am devoting the next three weeks to reading books, journal articles, and essays. This fall, my thesis proposal will happen.
