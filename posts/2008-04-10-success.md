Well, CSS Naked Day was a success. At least for this site.

Jessica and I picked up the new Raconteurs disc last night. The production and the sounds are incredible. I'm going to hold off on a review, because I've only listened to it once. But what I've heard so far impressed me.

Also, thanks to [Randall Jenkins](http://randallpauljenkins.com/), this blog is now iPhone/iPod Touch optimized. I'll be adding a bookmarklet image today. Yay!

It is pouring rain today. And I'm listening to Jayhawks. Hopefully today will be better than yesterday.
