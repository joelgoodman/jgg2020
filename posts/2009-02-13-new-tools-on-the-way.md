Today I ordered a new MacBook Pro (finally) to replace my ailing PowerBook G4 12". I'm really excited. No more having to wait 15 seconds to do anything on my G4. I'll finally be productive at home and not have to use my work computer on the weekends!

I also picked up an Airport Extreme for us, since we'll both have Draft-N wireless cards and I've been using a B/G router forever. And later, I've got plans for a NAS in our house.

Exciting times.
