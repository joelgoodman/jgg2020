I have just finished my last day as web marketing manager at Trinity International University. I no longer have an institutional paycheck, my benefits run out at the end of the month. But Jessica and I are embarking on a crazy new adventure, and *that* is exciting.

"We must sail and not drift" is what [the t-shirt I am wearing](http://www.randomobjects.net/product/a-sailor-s-life) today reminds me. Complacency is not an option. Go somewhere, have a goal and meet it, and don't get sidetracked along the way. I think this phrase will hold a special place in my mind this year as I figure out the different options I have, craft the perfect message and vision, and create some incredible user interfaces.

The heat is one part of what I look forward to. The food is another. But the freedom. Yeah, the freedom of *going* is what really pushes me. Being able to do the projects I want to do (or don't want to do, but free to choose either way), go places I want to go, and create things I want to create. These things seem important.

We must sail... in a week we'll push off.
