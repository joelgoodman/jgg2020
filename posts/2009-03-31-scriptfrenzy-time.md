Last November Jessica and I participated in the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) and each wrote our own 50k word novel in a month. It was absolutely crazy. And awesome. (If you want to read the trash I wrote, let me know in the comments)

Well, starting tomorrow ewe will be starting our own 100 page scripts for this year's [ScriptFrenzy](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/) event. I am half excited and half nervous to do ScriptFrenzy. I've never written nor attempted to write a script and am at a little bit of a loss at how this is going to work.

I'm planning to adapt this fantastic novel by Michael Cox called [*The Meaning of Night*](http://readernaut.com/joelgoodman/books/0393330346/the-meaning-of-night/) to the screen. I read this book in January and fell in love with the story. It's so dark and mysterious and exciting. There is plenty of suspense, great characters, and witty dialogue. I think it would make a beautiful film.

So tomorrow we start. Sometime before LOST I guess. If you're doing ScriptFrenzy, and you would like to, add me as a [writing buddy](http://www.scriptfrenzy.org/eng/user/439200).

If you'd like to read my script as we go along, let me know and I'll see what I can do. I suppose it wouldn't be a bad idea to do it like I did with NaNoWriMo. So, there'll be a private post of the script. If you want to read it over the month, comment and let me know and I'll create an account for you.
