Jessica and I spent the weekend demo-ing our "library" room. Okay, to be honest, she stripped wallpaper and I demoed the walls around the stairs. Our changes are going to look amazing. I took out one wall surrounding our first flight of stairs before the landing. It makes the room look a lot bigger. I'll be building a half wall this week with 1x6 that'll be painted and placed on top as a sort of banister. It's going to look great.

Then we have a row of bead board wainscoting that'll travel round the rest of the room, with a chair rail at the top and a wide baseboard. All in a rich chocolate brown. It's going to be incredible. I would have finished the stairs today but didn't have the lumber I needed. And with a Home Depot/Lowes being half hour away (not to mention gas prices here being $3.18) and our lumberyard being closed Sundays, I got stuck. I could've reused some of the old wood from the framing, but it's super hard. I need some new tools!

I'll have to get some photos up here, but at the moment I am too comfortable to get up and grab the camera and find a USB cable.
