...is going by SO slowly. What is the deal? Maybe it's because summer is ending and people are showing up on campus. It's probably more closely related to the fact that I am waiting for people to answer me.

I lost my iPod Touch. I'm not sure how, but I know when. Monday. It has to be in the house someplace. Absolutely has to be. See, I got home. I remember seeing it where I had set it down and grabbing it because it wasn't supposed to be there. I went upstairs, did some GRE studying, ate dinner, went back upstairs to do some more, came downstairs and Jessica took me to Dairy Queen (drive-thru) to cheer me up.

Got back, watched TV. We haven't *gone* anywhere. And I haven't been able to find it since Tuesday morning. It's super-annoying. I hope I find it soon.

We got a cucumber today from our garden. And we ate it. Well, half of it. In a chicken salad. It's really good.

I am really stressed about the GRE. I need to get a better score on it this time so that I can get into the school i want. Hopefully this Kaplan stuff will pay off. But it doesn't seem to be yet. And I take the test next tuesday.

Please pray for me.
