My dad made me a *Star Trek* fan at a very early age. I'm not sure I'd call myself a devoted Trekkie, but I love the show - especially The Next Generation, but mostly because that was what I grew up with on tv.

That said, I am SO excited for the new J.J. Abrams -directed film. One of my favourite writer/directors taking over the *Trek* mantle is awesome. Particularly because the writers on his team that handled the new script are die-hard fans of the franchise even if Abrams himself is not.

Yesterday Gizmodo posted the submissions to there latest [photoshop contest](http://i.gizmodo.com/5211593/star-trek-gets-ruined-in-80-ways-jj-abrams-could-never-dream-of) which was all about ruining the new *Star Trek* film. I found it pretty hilarious and it provided me a good five minutes of laughing at my desk. A lot of the submissions were, unsurprisingly, smash-ups of *Star Trek* and *Star Wars*. And were really funny.

So along those lines, here's a YouTube video [@kevinkirchner](http://twitter.com/kevinkirchner) found... and it's funny.
