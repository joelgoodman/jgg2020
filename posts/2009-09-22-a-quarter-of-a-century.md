Today I turn 25 years old.

1. Wow. That's a quarter of a century.

[Jessica](http://waysideviolet.com) bought me a straight razor and some awesome shaving soap. She also had some caramel/chocolate shipped in from an Etsy seller in Paris.

Tonight we're going out for dinner with friends to an excellent restaurant. Then my wife is going to take me out to St Louis tomorrow to go birthday shopping.

All in all, a good birthday so far, with lots of promise.

Also, [David Hechler](http://dhechler.com) informed me that today is both summer and fall (as it turns to Autumn around 5:something PM tonight). That's interesting, I think.
