Wow. What a week. I got back from the HighEdWeb conference on Wednesday night. It was a blast. Great group of people--amazing to see some old friends and to finally meet a few newer ones face to face.

I wrote up a post [about my thoughts](/posts/state-of-highedweb), and I'm not going to reiterate any of that here. Except there's one point I want to emphasize. The #heweb community is fantastic. When I finally make the leap out of HighEdWeb and into academia or graphic design or something else, these people are what I am going to miss the most.

Some strange stories, a lot of fun, and some thought inducing lectures. Excited for where I am taking the next year.

So, so glad I got to hang out with people like @[billyadams](http://twitter.com/billyadams), @[mikepetroff](http://twitter.com/mikepetroff), @[lougan](http://twitter.com/lougan), @[MalloryWood](http://twitter.com/MalloryWood), @[lanejoplin](http://twitter.com/lanejoplin), @[kylejames](http://twitter.com/kylejames), @[fienen](http://twitter.com/fienen), @[NikkiMK](http://twitter.com/NikkiMK), @[nickdenardis](http://twitter.com/nickdenardis), @[radiofreegeorgy](http://twitter.com/radiofreegeorgy), etc., etc., etc. Hope to see you all soon.
