Well, not entirely new. This week I'll be working on converting AgapeFest.com into a quick micro-blog for festival week.

What does that mean? It means I've got all of my staff that have iPhones, picture messaging or Flip cameras set to take photos and post them to Twitter/Twitpic. Then AgapeFest.com will pull each of those in and create a post about them. If I had been thinking, I could've used this as an opportunity to learn how and then write my own WordPress plugin for it. Maybe later.

In any case, I think this is going to be super fun. By the way, does anyone know of a Twitpic-like service that does video instead? Like if I had my Flip out there, little 30 sec to 1-minute videos would be awesome. I'd better buy some batteries...
