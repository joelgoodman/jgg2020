I saw the BBC report on 5 November about Russia moving missiles to block a missile shield the US has been planning in Poland. Our purpose, as far as we know, is for it to serve as a protective barrier to Russia's neighboring countries. We don't want another Georgia issue like we had earlier this year.

But tonight I found the article The Telegraph posted and it adds in some details I didn't realize. Apparently Russia is not all that happy with our new president-elect.

[Read the story](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/barackobama/3385988/Russia-welcomes-Barack-Obama-with-deployment-of-nuclear-capable-missiles.html). It's entertaining.
