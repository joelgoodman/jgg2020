I read [Consumerist](http://consumerist.com) a lot lately. It's awesome. But also, last week they linked to Not Always Right. And they are the best things for killing time. So funny. At least if you've ever worked in retail or customer service. Like this one:

> ### [Playing Along, Part 2](http://notalwaysright.com/playing-along-part-2/569)
>
> TECH SUPPORT | IDAHO, USA
>
>
> *(I get a call for troubleshooting from a lady who says her remote doesn’t work.)*
>
> **Me:** “Ok ma’am, could you try changing the channel for me? Tell me if a light flashes on the remote.”
>
> **Lady:** “Ok.”
>
> *(There are a few loud beeps from her phone in my ear and she comes back on the line.)*
>
> **Lady:** “Nope, no flashing.”
>
> **Me:** “Ma’am you’re trying to change the channel with your phone, not the remote control.”
>
> **Lady:** “I can’t find the clicker, and I know my neighbor changes channels with her phone.”
>
> **Me:** “Ma’am, that’s just not possible.”
>
> **Lady:** “Don’t accuse me of lying! I saw her do it with my own eyes.”
>
> **Me:** “…”
>
> *(I try for 10 minutes to explain to her why she can’t use her phone, and even make a futile attempt to troubleshoot her phone.)*
>
> **Me:** “Ok, well it looks like your satellite receiver isn’t compatible with your phone.”
>
> **Lady:** “Yes it is. My neighbor and I have the same phone and same receiver. NOW HELP ME, DUMBA**!”
>
> **Me:** “Ma’am, do you have a cordless phone?”
>
> **Lady:** “Yes!”
>
> **Me:** “Ok ma’am, let’s try reprogramming your phone. What I need you to do is press and hold the ‘off’ button for five seconds. This will clear the old code, so we can put the new one in.”
>
> **Lady:** “Ok—” **click**
>
> *(I hear my supervisor a few rows away from me bust out laughing.)*

Check out the [website](http://notalwaysright.com) though. So funny.
