So. New things on this site. Comments are fixed and look good. Tags are now in the meta with a snazzy new icon (look below).

And that's all. So minor update, but things are looking good! Gotta get my résumé updated so I can show you the new and cool document download on the résumé page.

Anyway. I'm glad it's the weekend. Jess has a thing all day tomorrow so I am going to work on my grad school application. Then we're headed to eat fish & chips in St Louis with a bunch of friends for September birthdays (I am one of those). So, it's going to be FUN.
