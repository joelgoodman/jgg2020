I am now all set up. We went out and picked up a cheap desk for me last night, set it up in our alcove in the office, and now I have a proper place to work.

I've been trying to work with my new laptop while sitting on a futon and either balancing the computer on my lap or putting it on our short coffee table. It hasn't been comfortable.

But today I've gotten a lot of work done, sitting at my new desk! It's exciting.
