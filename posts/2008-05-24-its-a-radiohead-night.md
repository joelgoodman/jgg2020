I don't know why, maybe because I saw them on Jools Holland a few minutes ago or maybe just because it really doesn't feel like 8:32pm, but Radiohead just feels right. I miss Radiohead sometimes. Earlier today Jessica said, "I should listen to more Radiohead." I thought, *hell yes! finally!* I've been waiting for her to say those words.

So I've got all of their records on shuffle right now in iTunes, which I guess is the worst way to listen to Radiohead, but I'm not complaining. It's giving Jess a good sampling of their music.

We sat down a bit ago and she asked me if I draw. I guess we haven't really addressed that since we've been married. She said she bets I would be good at painting and drawing. And I am alright at both, if I do say so myself. So we drew and listened to Radiohead. It's been great.

Sometimes I think I should just go into visual design and photography and graphic imaging and stuff. I like it so much. Why didn't I study Digital Media in school? *head palm*

It being memorial day weekend and all, we had Micah over to grill. Surf and turf. It was excellent. Jessica's sister is staying with us tonight, and getting in around 12:30 I think. Late night. But a long weekend. I might go out and just take photos tomorrow. That sounds like a good idea.

Also got my PC up and running in tip-top shape. I'm thinking of doing photo edits on it since I've got a bigger/dual monitors there rather than this tiny 12" screen on my PowerBook. We'll see what happens.

I really want to start playing guitar again. I'm getting this craving to be artsy again. Maybe it's Radiohead induced? Probably. And we watched some Hillsong United DVD stuff today. Amazing. There are so many things I wish I could do with my life. But I feel like I can't. Strange.

Art or thought? Which do I want more?
