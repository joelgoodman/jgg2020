Yep, that's right. There's a brand new feature here. Check out the blogroll in the sidebar.

I think it's pretty awesome. And it's all thanks to [this](http://nettuts.com/javascript-ajax/building-a-better-blogroll-dynamic-fun-with-simplepie-and-jquery/) awesome little tutorial from NETTUTS. It's actually done by Chris Coyier over at CSS-Tricks (who's screencast helped me actually build this and several other WordPress templates from scratch).

I've hopefully got a few more tricks coming - I still need to fix that cloud up there. I'd rather run everything on jQuery and right now Scriptaculous is handling the cloud movement. So we'll see when I can find time to do that.

Anyway, what the blogroll does now. Under the Friends tab you'll find a list of the recent posts my blogroll friends have made. Under Favourites, you'll find the most recent posts from the blogs and sites I regularly read. And under List I've put my blogroll list so you can get out to the sites' homepage if you'd like. Check it out!
