I've got a problem managing my stress levels. This is especially the case when I have a lot of projects going on all at once, and my body starts to tell me it hates what's going on. Normally when I'm stressed I am in a lot of pain. It's in my shoulders, my neck, but especially my lower back. It's uncomfortable to sit, lay down, stand... just about everything.

The biggest issue is that I haven't found a way to deal with it properly. I used to handle it well but that hasn't been the case in a long time. One of the reasons I left my job at Greenville College in 2010 was that I was doing the job of four people and it was seriously affecting my health.

I love working hard and getting things done, but over the course of the past two years I think I've realized that I need focus in that work. Juggling projects is inevitable for someone like me doing the kind of work that I do and so it's become important to set aside time to focus on one or two tasks. If I can feel like I've gotten something done those stress symptoms calm down a bit.

My other realization is that I really need to exercise more. I don't think I'm unhealthy, but I am definitely not fit and I could use another outlet to work some of this out. I think exercise is where that needs to happen.

But lastly, I just need to finish more projects. Maybe take on smaller projects or maybe just have less of a role in executing on them, but I need to find ways to finish things more often. Last week we shipped two sites we were working on and there are more lined up. Every time I hit the deadline I feel a lot better and can relax a bit. My muscles loosen up, I sleep better and longer.

I hope in 2014 I can stay less stressed out, be happier in the work I'm doing, and keep the quality high. That's what I am working toward.
