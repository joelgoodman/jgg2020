These are taken away from Carol Wilder's Understanding Media Studies course at The New School.

1. What do I want to know?
2. Why does it matter? To whom?
3. What do we already know about the subject?
4. What is a workable research question?
5. How can I find the answer?
6. How can I analyze the results?
7. What conclusions can I draw?
8. What can I contribute to future studies?
9. How can I communicate the result to others?

This post is set up to be a reminder to me as I continue my masters degree. I need to be thinking about and answering these questions as I determine the research I want to do in this field.
