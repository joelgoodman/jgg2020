The fantastic [P is for Panda](http://pisforpanda.com) has released the equally (possibly moreso) fantasticÂ [Damion Suomi](http://twitter.com/daysuomi) record today. Jess and I got the album from @[chadpearson](http://twitter.com/chadpearson) last year and listened to it all winter long. It is SO good. Go buy the cheap download--and if you're up for it, the CD or LP. Great music from a great musician and from a label that's set on helping those less fortunate than ourselves. For a taste of the tunes, check out the live video below.
