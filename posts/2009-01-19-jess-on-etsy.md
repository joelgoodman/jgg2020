My wife has opened an Etsy.com store with some super cool knit items for sale. Right now she's got some awesome cable knit coffee sleeves/cozies for sale. She made me one for Christmas and it's awesome. Way cooler than those ones you get at Starbucks, reusable, and therefore less wasteful. [Head over to her store to check them out](http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=6668261). And at least give her a good rating!
