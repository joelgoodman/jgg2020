Today Jessica and I went to IKEA to get me a new desk. Freelance work has been really good lately and I've needed a better work area - something more inspiring where I can focus a bit better than before. I had a sad, small little desk that we had bought in Greenville. The size was perfect for the work area I had there, but we have a lot more room in our office here in Vernon Hills.

I ended up with the GALANT desk system. It's basically a white glass table. And I love it.
