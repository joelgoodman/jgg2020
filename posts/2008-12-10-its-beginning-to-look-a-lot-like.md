I froze AgapeFest.com yesterday. It was tons of fun. Sometimes I like just being completely corny in a design, and AF gives me that opportunity, since Jr High and High School students are the demographic.

And it's "snowing" on this blog too. I'm half getting tired of this template. I might work on a new one once my other jobs are out of the way. Any opinions on that?

Also, I'm usin IntenseDebate for my commenting now, and you should really sign up for an account. It tracks where you comment (if they're using IntenseDebate, that is) and it's owned by Automattic who develop and maintain WordPress (running this blog). Anyway. Just a recommendation. You can respond to individual comments now and they'll be threaded, like on a forum or bb.

Happy Christmas Time!
