So yeah... Tornado warning. Tornado siren. We go downstairs, it goes off. Then we look out the back windows. It's super-dark. So we decide to go downstairs to the basement. And that's where we sit now. I ran upstairs to get my camera and looked outside... it was pretty scary looking.

Anyway. That's what's up. If I get some photos I'll post them. But I'm not sure Jess wants me to leave her in the basement with the doggy.
