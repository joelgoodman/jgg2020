I just pushed stop on my DVR after a half hour of non-stop craziness from two Finnish man-boys racing across Russia experiencing whatever they can lay their eyes and hands on.

Exploring an abandoned city that was the site of nuclear holocaust, being treated with and then eating leeches, jumping off of St. Petersburg rooftops attached to a bungee cord... The sneak peek of Travel Channel's [Madventures](http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Madventures) was insane. In fact, I can't remember the last time I was so excited about a new television show.

It's not just that they do crazy things. No. The show is shot with so much energy. Tunna, one of the hosts and the show's director/cinematographer, is brilliant. His shots are amazing. The programme itself is just really gorgeous. The image quality, camera angles, and editing make the show high-energy and a joy to watch.

Past that, the hosts, Riku and Tunna, are infectious. They are exciting, energetic and funny. I can't wait for this show to start up in full swing this September. Here's the opening so you can get a taste of what it's like:
