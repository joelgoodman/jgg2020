Now that NaNoWriMo is over, I have weekends back. That means I can pack in the worthwhile activities I've been putting off in favour of writing my novel (which is still about 2k words from having the story finish).

This weekend we redid my entire office at work. Painted everything but the floor and ceiling, hung art, rearranged desks and cleaned. It looks awesome. I'll post photos tomorrow.

Right now I'm waiting for my Christmas card design to upload so that Jess and I can get them printed and then mailed tomorrow. Yay Christmas! We've been watching Christmas movies (*A Christmas Story* is on right now), listening to Christmas music and wrapping up our shopping to-dos. Jess and I love giving presents.

And our anniversary is in about a week and a half. We're going to head out to the St Louis Art Museum for the afternoon because she has a final that day. Afterward, we're going to this awesome looking gastropub that over by Powell Symphony Hall and the Fox Theatre. It's going to be a great 3rd anniversary.
