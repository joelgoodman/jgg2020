I feel really good this evening. I spent two days today doing markup and styling for the new AgapeFest.com and I must say I feel really good about it. It is rewarding to me to come up with and then implement a design that actually looks good.

What's been particularly rewarding to me this time around is building the entire theme from scratch. I've learned a little bit more about templating for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), and my love for the platform is ever-increasing.

I can't wait to put this live. I just don't know when... I'll have it finished next week. I have probably 90% of the styling done, have one IE 6 bug to fix, and then I'll start getting other bits together like the AgapeFest flickr group photostream integrated. I'm also planning to do Twitter integration and some other stuff. Anyway.
