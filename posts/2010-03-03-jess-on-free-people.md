[Jessica's](http://waysideviolet.com) coffee cup cozies are being featured on the [Free People blog](http://blog.freepeople.com/2010/03/cozy-coffee/) today! Free People is a clothing company that is also the brains behind Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie.

Make sure you go over to the [Free People post](http://blog.freepeople.com/2010/03/cozy-coffee/) and comment about how cool her cozies are. And (shameless plug) check out her [shop on Etsy](http://waysideviolet.etsy.com) to pick a couple up!
