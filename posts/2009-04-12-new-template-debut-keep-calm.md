Brand spankin' new in time for Easter to be ending. This is my new blog design for [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), my personal favourite platform to blog on.

It's been about a year since I debuted a new design and I've felt long over due for a new style. I think this design (entitled *Keep Calm*) better represents my personality. And my Anglo-centrism (yeah, ask me about it).

I'm doing some tweaking to some aspects of it still since I developed it locally without my remote server setup and all its widgets and content. Widgets always cause problems :) And apparently so will Firefox. (It looks fantastic in Safari and other Webkit based browsers) In any case, it's mostly solid and I kind of love the way it turned out.

Let me know what you think in the comments! Even if you're not as ecstatic with it as I am, it'd be great to hear your thoughts.
