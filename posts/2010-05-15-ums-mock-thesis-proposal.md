*ABSTRACT*

> *The convergence of media must, at some point, hit a critical mass.  The point where convergence becomes a non-issue and new media cultures become ingrained into the everyday persona is where we are heading.  This project will analyze the work being done on the fringes of participatory culture and suggest ways in which digital worlds will interact seamlessly with the embodied world.  Cultural norms, politics, economics, and societal conventions will be affected by the new New Media.*
