So... I am in Springfield, MO right now. I've been through two presentations already and am about to watch one on cross-site scripting -- which should be fun.

This is a great conference. Way better than that Aslanian one I was sent to last year. And I've met some cool people and done some networking. Productive and fun. And I got free stuff.

I'll be here until Wednesday. I'll have one day of "real" work this week and then Thursday night Jess, Cors, and I are heading out to West Virginia to see her parents and meet up with [Harry](http://mynameisharry.tumblr.com) to bring him out to Illinois. It's going to be a busy couple of weeks.
