Jessica and I had a fantastic Thanksgiving, and I hope yours was great too. Once again we made the trek out to Hurricane, West Virginia to spend the holiday with her parents. Jess' grandma was able to be with us too for T-day and an early Christmas.

In three weeks we'll be flying out to California for a West coast Christmas tour. My parents house is first, then we'll drive up to Portland, Oregon with them just before the new year. My sister's wedding is the first week of January, in Portland, and after that we'll be heading home.

So, busy busy times ahead.

We're also thinking about having a small Christmas dinner party with some friends. The school I work at gave the faculty and staff a turkey for Christmas. Well, with us leaving for the holiday, we're going to have a turkey to get rid of and we certainly can't do it on our own.

I am so ready for a break. I need to regain some mental health, I think. And I also have some designs to work on and some new projects to get started.

Hope you're having a great holiday season.
