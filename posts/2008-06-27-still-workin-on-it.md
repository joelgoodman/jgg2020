It was a busy day for me today - Slept in, interviewed a potential hiree for my old position, cruised STL for a while. But I am still working on getting the subdomain up. I might be closer. Hopefully. Gotta say though, shared hosting is not as easy as it should be; especially with GoDaddy.

Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted. Oh, and cool photos will be uploaded tomorrow after I've slept and had time to process them.
