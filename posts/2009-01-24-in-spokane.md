Jess and I flew into Spokane last night. 8ish hours of flying. My aunt's 60th birthday is today and we've joined my parents, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandpa here to celebrate. It's been great so far, I just wish we had a little more time. I had forgotten how gorgeous Washington state is.

Lots of snow, lots of laughter, tons of fun.
