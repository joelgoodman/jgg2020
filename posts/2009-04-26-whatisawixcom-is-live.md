Super stoked about this one...

I've been working on a blog design for my friend [Wix](http://whatisawix.com) for awhile. He came to me in January, I think, and asked about getting a site designed and built for him.

The beauty was that he wasn't in a rush and so I was able to work on this among all the other projects and sites and work I was doing. I felt kind of bad because it took awhile, but he's been travelling a lot too...

Anyway, long story short. We hit it kind of hard this last week and have pushed it out for release today!

The overall design style for me is a bit different than what I'm used to. I took it as sort mid-90s + New Wave + Grunge and did a bunch of vector art and half-tone sort of things.

In any case, I'm happy to have it finished and live! Head over [whatisawix.com](http://whatisawix.com) and check it out! Let me (and him) know what you think.
