My favourite HD channel is, by far, [Palladia](http://www.palladia.tv/).

This 1080i music channel is pretty phenomenal. In last two weeks of getting acquainted with our HD programming, I've seen footage from countless UK music festivals and Coachella 2006, Oasis in concert, music videos and tonight, All-American Rejects live in concert. All in glorious high definition. I've got Weezer live in Japan set to record to the DVR next.

Imagine my surprise to find out Palladia is an MTV channel! An MTV channel that only plays music?? Amazing. They've definitely done something right with this channel. It's fantastic and my favourite.
