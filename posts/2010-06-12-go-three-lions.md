### Rule Britannia

> *When Britain fi-i-irst, at heaven's command,
> Aro-o-o-o-ose from out the a-a-a-zure main,
> Arose, arose from out the azure main,
> This was the charter, the charter of the land,
> And guardian A-a-angels sang this strain:
> *
> ***Rule Britannia!
>
> Britannia rule the waves
>
> Britons never, never, never will be slaves.
>
> Rule Britannia!
>
> Britannia rule the waves.
>
> Britons never, never, never will be slaves.**
> *
>
> *Still more maje-e-estic shalt thou rise,
>
> More dre-e-e-e-eadful from each foreign stroke,
>
> More dreadful, dreadful from each foreign stroke,
>
> Loud blast above us, loud blast that tears the skies
>
> Serves but to ro-o-o-ot thy native oak.
> *
>
> ***Rule Britannia!
>
> Britannia rule the waves.
>
> Britons never, never, never will be slaves.
>
> Rule Britannia!
>
> Britannia rule the waves.

> Britons never, never, never will be slaves.***
