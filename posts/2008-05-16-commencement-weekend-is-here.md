It's that time of year again here at GC. The seniors are lining up for ritual rehearsals, I am busy working in PowerPoint (kill me) and going to random events where all I do is shake hands, snap photos and film ceremonies. Plus I work the whole weekend.

We have President's Society dinner tonight, I filmed a building dedication yesterday. I've got another dedication to film tomorrow and then Non-Traditional Commencement to shoot photos of in the afternoon. Saturday is Baccalaureate and Traditional Commencement, both photo jobs.

Sunday we're going out to St. Louis for a graduation-type party for some of our friends that are leaving. And next week I move a bunch of websites and prepare for summer work.

I'm hoping next weekend I can re-gutter and maybe plant a tree and move some tulip bulbs/shovel dirt. Yay manual labour!
