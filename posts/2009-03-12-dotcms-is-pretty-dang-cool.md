So at work we are in the process of moving our CMS platform from Joomla! to [dotCMS](http://dotcms.org).

We just finished two days of basic training in dotCMS and I am super excited. The CMS is built on Java, but don't hold that against it. The user side of it is nimble and ridiculously flexible. Everything cool is done in Apache Velocity code which makes it simple to do pulls.

Basically, if all goes according to plan, we'll be going from 20k pages of content to about 30 pages with all of the content being dynamically pulled. Simply, how a CMS should work.

I'm excited. We got to do some cool things with velocity in our training yesterday and have a second training round coming up.
