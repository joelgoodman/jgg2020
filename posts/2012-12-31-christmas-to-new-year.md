It's the last day of 2012. What's up with that?

[Jessica](https://waysideviolet.com) and I got the opportunity to fly back to California on Christmas morning and spend a few days with my family. Both of my sisters and my brother-in-law were in from Portland, too. It was great to have the whole family together on Christmas and I think did my mom some good having all the kids at home.

We did a family photoshoot out in the desert, too, and that was a lot of fun. Time goofing off and cracking jokes with everyone.

My cousin got married on Friday and we flew home on Saturday. Now we're back in Austin on a drizzly New Year's Eve morning (crazy, right?) getting mentally prepared to start the new year and celebrate a good year gone by with new friends.

There's a lot to look forward to in 2013. There'll be a new, more exhaustive post about all of that, but just a couple of coming highlights:

- I'll be writing a book
- Jessica will be coming to work for [Bravery](https://bravery.co), helping me keep up with everything
- Travel to England for a friend's wedding
- A new blog/resource going live a bit later #hustleishope
- And a few other surprises

I'm looking forward to the new year; I'm especially excited that I'll get to spend more time working alongside my wife and creating some great new things. It'll be great to see what Austin continues to hold for us. We picked such a great city to move to. Come visit us in 2013!
