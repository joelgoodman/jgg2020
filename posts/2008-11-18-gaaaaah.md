This is the most frustrating project I've had to deal with in a long time.

- They can't send images separate from a Word document but wonder why they get messed up in the conversion.
- They send me the wrong content and I work hours to get it up just to find out it's wrong and I have to redo it.
- They insist on *calling* me instead of emailing. Come on! I don't need a phone call, I just need the correct information. Email is SO much more efficient for me.
- They think theirs is the only project I'm working on. And they give me their content last minute. Not the one week ahead of time policy we have in place.
- They don't know how to use a computer!!!

Makes me so mad. Anyway. Thank you blog for letting me vent.
