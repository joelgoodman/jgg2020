My friends Kris and Chase created the site [manbabies.com](http://manbabies.com) - in the two months or so that it's been online the site has been featured on VH1's Best Day Ever website and Neatorama.com (as well as others).

Well, tonight I saw a tweet by Leo Laporte ([TWiT.tv](http://twit.tv)) linking to [Revision3](http://revision3.com) and Martin Sargent's show Internet Superstar. As I started to watch, I was surprised to hear Martin talking about how he was going to have the creator of manbabies.com on his show. Sure enough, about three minutes in, there's my friend Kris Truitt ON TV... sort of. It's the internet, but it's like TV. Basically.
