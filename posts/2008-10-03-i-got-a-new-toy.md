And it's fun. I got enough birthday money to get a Wacom Bamboo, and while it's not the top-of-the-line, it's really awesome. It'll take some getting used to, but I'm already liking it a lot. Not sure it'll replace the mouse, but I hope it will!

I'm really excited to start drawing with it and using it in Photoshop and Illustrator. I think it'll help my design go more organic. But we'll see.

Anyway. It is a happy day in Joel-land. And on Sunday I'm leaving for Springfield, MO for the HighEdWeb Conference. And thanks to the fantastic community they've built on Ning already, I'm way more excited to meet everyone than I was for the Aslanian conference I went to last year.

This group of people seems a lot more fun-loving and relaxed, and that's what I expect from people in the web/tech field. So, I think it'll be lots of fun. And I'll get some more great ideas for what we can implement on the site at work. Exciting.
