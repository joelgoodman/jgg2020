We're moved. To new hosting, that is. And propagation only took about 20 minutes, which is really quick. I'm sure you've realized this, but there is more to theGoodmanBlog.com than just this blog. It's also housed my wife Jessica's blog. And now, I'm hosting my mom's blog (weird? eh... not much. and we have the same last name).

How does he do it? Well, I'm running this, my "special" install of WordPress. And by special I really mean selfish. It is all for me. And on the other side of the stream, I am running [WordPressMU](http://mu.wordpress.org), which, if you haven't heard, is the multi-user (get it? MU? Muti User???) mod of WordPress. Jess's blog was easy to put over there since it's basic. Just photos and posts. My mom had one post made on Vox (which is super easy to import to WP as well) so restarting on WP was an easy fix. Plus she's get a good URL and could have an email address if she wants.

It also feels good to back with a cPanel enabled host instead of stupid Godaddy with their disorganized and messy interface.

Now, I'm in the process of designing and building my dad's site [meritasinc.com](http://meritasinc.com) and then I'll get back to work on this site. I stopped right in the middle of putting together my portfolio and photography pages. I did manage to get my [CV](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/curriculum-vitae) updated and looking... moderately okay. I might tweak it a bit. And I'm getting all kinds of cool ideas from around the web. It's gonna be fun! More maintenance!
