Yay internet! So yesterday a link on [Matt Mullenweg's](http://ma.tt) blog showed up in my WordPress admin. The post contained a link to [this post](http://css-tricks.com/designing-for-wordpress-complete-series-downloads/) on css-tricks.com. If you are a WordPress designer, that post is an excellent resource. It's a screencast of how to create your own WordPress theme from scratch. Which is nice.

Up until now, I've been building my themes on top of an excellent theme framework called [Sandbox](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/). Sandbox is excellent, but I haven't really building themes - I've just been styling over the top of a very well made theme.

Now, that's all well and good, but I'm a control freak. I was editing certain things in the Sandbox framework (the way meta was displayed; changing phrasings... etc.). And tweaking someone else's theme is great, but I always hated the prospect of releasing my styled version of it as my own. Obviously, because it wasn't.

In any case, that screencast offers up a link to a theme called Starkers, which is basically just a stripped out, reset, unstyled, foundational structure for a WordPress theme taken from the WP Default theme. No semantic classes really, no markup to speak of, just a really blank canvas.

The instructions in the screencast are great as well because he walks you step by step into creating a theme.

So at this point, I am going to start transitioning all of the themes I have built on top of Sandbox (which, if I'm counting right, is three and one in the works) to actually be custom themes built by me. Yay!

And on that note, this is a video that is one of my favourites that I have also failed to post to this blog. If you've seen it, you can't see it enough.
