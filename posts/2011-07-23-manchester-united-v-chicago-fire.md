This afternoon we got the chance to see the Manchester United play the Chicago Fire at Soldier Field in downtown Chicago. Great match, with an outcome that I expected. The Fire managed to score one goal in the first half against Man United's newer players. But in the second half Sir Alex played the club's stars.

Rooney scored Manchester United's first goal in the second half, followed by goals from both Rafael and Nani. The final result was 3-1 in favour of United. It was interesting to see Chicago start playing in the second half when really challenged. Maybe that's all the MLS needs, more challenge... stiffer odds. Maybe we need a chance to rise to the occasion.

Though I am definitely not a Manchester United supporter, I am less of a Fire supporter. It was amazing to see some decent football in a pretty great stadium for the occasion.
