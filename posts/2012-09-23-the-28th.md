Starting my 28th year...

Last year when I wrote [my annual birthday post](http://joel.thegoodmanblog.com/23752/turning-27/) it was a lot of retrospect and wondering what the future would bring. This year I am working harder and more focused than ever. We made huge leaps this past year. Jessica and I had lengthy discussions about our future and what we needed to accomplish. A central part of that was moving away from Chicagoland and me parting ways with my formal work in higher education.

Today, in Austin, I am having more fun working than I have since all the activities I threw myself into in college. I'm in demand, still, and I'm coming to terms with what that means. Austin, and working around the right people, [has opened doors for me](https://bravery.co) that I am constantly walking through. I'm designing for startups, for colleges and universities, for consulting and development firms, for web services... I'm making more money on my own than I ever have at a salaried job. And on top of that I have more time to devote to Jessica, to hobbies and interests, and to finding community.

I view this year, my 28th year of life, as the real start to our future. The decisions we make this year will shape what we do for the next decade: where we go, what we study, when we'll decide to have kids, what differences we'll make.

I'm excited.
