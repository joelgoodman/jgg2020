Last night we stood in line in the rain and cold for like, half an hour, to see Feist at the Pageant. Jessica got tickets early through the Feist mailing list and lucky for us she did, because the show sold out.

What a weird crowd too. I mean, it *was* St Louis, and it's normally kind of a strange crowd anyway, but we had a group of people in their fifties (or sixties) in front of us. It kind of sucked when we were trying to see past their heads, but sort of funny when one of the ladies had had three (or maybe four, I lost count) beers. I'm not sure she was used to drinking so much.

Feist's friend Hayden (from Toronto) opened for her. He did a pretty good set on guitar, piano and harmonica. Just him, alone on the stage. When he had about two songs left he scolded the crowd for talking saying something like: Before I do this next song I just wanted to let you guys know that there's a half hour between my set and when Feist comes on and I've only been to St Louis three times. I'd like you guys to hear some of my music, so you can talk to your friends during that half hour.

It was pretty funny.

I liked Hayden, he was good. When Feist started though, they brought out a screen and projected her shadow onto it. On the massive backdrop they projected shadow puppets and live art the whole time. It was pretty awesome. They had a camera guy too who was filming random things. On "My Moon, My Man" the pianist's hands were on the screen, and while he was playing, he picked up a Strat and started playing guitar. It was AWESOME.

Her opening song was just a mix of her singing random sounds (sort of). See, she has a sampler on stage and sings into a 57 to sample for her vocal harmonies. The 57 distorts, like all good 57s do. It was amazing. The reverb they apply to her voice live is INCREDIBLE. I don't think I've ever heard a concert that sonically sounded so good.

There was one song when the art being projected was (we think) liquid graphite that the artist would manipulate into waves with her hands as the music went on. They also projected shadow cut-outs of birds and lanterns and leaves.

When Feist got to "1, 2, 3, 4" they lit up the backdrop all the colours of the ipod. And everyone started dancing. Because, you know, it's the single. But it was good. The songs all sounded better live than they do on the record which is saying something because her albums are pretty amazing sounding.

The guy next to us was wasted, which was kind of funny. At one point we counted 9 bottles between him and his girlfriend. But I'm sure he had more than that. He offered to buy me a beer when I watched his seats for them. My first "buy you a beer" moment.

The show went buy fast, but she played for probably an hour and a half. Not the two and a half of Ryan Adams, but a decent set. She's funny on stage too. Really great with the crowd. She did a three-song encore at the end.

Anyway. If you like Feist, you'll LOVE her live show. Definitely worth the $30 we shelled over to see her live in St Louis
