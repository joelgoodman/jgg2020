Or so I am assuming. My current hosting arrangement (with [Jon D](http://www.claphammedia.com)) is up in October. The first of the month, actually. So I have purchased new hosting away from my current host. Which is good in many ways. It also means that you could see some hiccups as I transition. Specifically, this site may be down at times over the next couple of days. I apologize. But it is necessary.

Also. My birthday is tomorrow. Huzzah!
