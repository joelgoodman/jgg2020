My wife takes really cool photos. She took this while I was punching out the dough for our pizza crust a couple of days ago. There's something very therapeutic about making dough. I love the sifting and kneading and the smell of the yeast and the flour...

Yeah, I'm a big fan of bread making.

Check out more pizza-making photos (and other cool ones) in [Jessica's Flickr Photostream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wayside_violet/).
