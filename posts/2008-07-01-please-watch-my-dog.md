Is there anyone in Greenville the Greenville/STL area that can watch/entertain our dog while we are gone this weekend and next week??

We'll make this easy too! You can take our bundle of fur to your place, or stay at ours. Or you could come play with him for a few hours every day.

We're kind of desperate. We leave Thursday.

Any takers? PLEASE?!?!?!
