I registered for classes last night. And it feeeeeeels good.

I'm taking two required seminar courses and a design course that I am excited about. Color theory, typography, layoutâ€¦ it's going to be great.

Can't wait to start! Apparently orientation videos will be online on Monday and the processes to add me to Blackboard will also run. And allegedly I have no textbooks? That can't be right.

I'll have to check that out again later...
