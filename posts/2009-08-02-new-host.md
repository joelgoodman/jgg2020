I've started to migrate my sites to DreamHost. It's been awesome so far, and I'm glad to FINALLY be with them.

Getting over to DreamHost has been a plan of mine since college, I just haven't been able to afford it/have already had hosting.

In any case. DreamHost was super easy to setup, provides tons of space and bandwidth (unlimited) and is pretty affordable when you purchase in bulk. It's also super fast. A lot faster than my previous host.

If you're interested in using DreamHost, please use my email joel [at] thegoodmanblog [dot] com or click through this [link](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?569462). And, I'd love to answer any questions you have.

Ummmm... that's about it. This weekend is going to be about getting everything moved over. Jessica has a new job and it makes her work some evenings. Which is sad. But I am hoping to use some of that down time to write music. I've been feeling the urge to write for a few weeks, so hopefully this time will be productive for me.

Hopefully there are some other exciting changes happening in the next few months, but nothing I can talk about yet. I have a couple cool projects going on and some other prospects in the works. Stay tuned.
