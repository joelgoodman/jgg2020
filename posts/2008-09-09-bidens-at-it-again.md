Biden's constant missteps make me kind of embarrassed for the Obama camp. At the same time, someone in their once near-impeccable PR department has to be slamming their head against their desk (if not [throwing their computer monitor out the window](http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/18/discomfited-german-hurls-pc-from-window-police-sympathize/)).

> During a campaign event in Columbia, Missouri, Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said, "I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect."

That's certainly not helping anything Joe. Especially when you consider who your opponent is.
Oh but of course the Obama camp tried to spin it in their favour:

> "This is a clash of policies, not a clash of personalities," Wade said. "We've heard not a dime's worth of difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans."

Except that's not what Biden actually *said*. He raised a fallacy and then charged his opponent with not caring; i.e., if you care you must support stem cell research.

Nice job offending your opponent Joe. Keep up the good work.
