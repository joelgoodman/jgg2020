[Eric Martin](http://www.ericmartin.com) helped me out a bit to resolve any potential issues [ln wikipedia]jQuery[/ln] might have been having and also pointed out two js errors that my site was coming up with. Those errors were in the default prototype.js that comes with WordPress. So I took the opportunity to upgrade [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/) and Prototype and all is well now. Just need to style the box a bit.
