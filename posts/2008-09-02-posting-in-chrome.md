Wow. So, Google Chrome was announced yesterday and introduced today. I downloaded it and am running it in Fusion on my Mac Pro at work. And it is SPEEDY. And I like the design. I wish it was a bit less cartoony and a bit more flat. But overall, I'm enjoying the experience. The browser itself really does just get out of the way. And Gears is built in.

I can't wait till they release the Mac version. It could very well become my browser of choice. So far I'm impressed. We'll see how this thing goes.
