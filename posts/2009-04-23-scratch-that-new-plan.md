Yeah, that last post. Forget it.

I totally forgot about WordPress' XML-RPC features and that I could use a service (like [PixelPipe](http://pixelpipe.com)) to update it. I looked into using this new service called [Posterous](http://posterous.com) - but it was too restrictive in having to verify emails to be able to post that I had to abandon it. Doesn't work so well when I have 6+ people needing to use the service to update the blog and Twitter.

But PixelPipe offers a common email upload and will update everything including YouTube. So. Awesome. That's the plan. I'll have to do some testing (and I think LunarPages breaks the XML-RPC capabilities... I can't get it to work on this or any blog on my server) to see what the formatting is like, but I think this will be a better solution.
