Well, after three years or so, my PowerBook G4 has finally lost its sound card.

I'm not sure how it happened. I ran a RAM scan for like, three or four hours because this computer crawls anyway. I had replaced the 256mb stick that was in here with a 1GB stick bringing my total RAM to 1.25GB. And since then there really hasn't been much of a change in speed.

When I rebooted after the RAM scan (which turned out fine, btw)...

I noticed a missing speaker icon. I'm pretty sure that means OS X failed to initiate the hardware. So... another reason why I need a new Mac. And another piece to motivate me. I might try putting Tiger back on and see if a fresh OS install fixes it (not sure why it would... this isn't Windows).

But in the meantime, I am saving my pennies and waiting for the MacBook Pro refresh that has been floating around the rumorsphere for so long...
