I've been out at the fairgrounds today for a few hours already. Mainstage is going up. When I left for lunch they were still getting the lighting up. It's freaking winding today and that's never a good thing.

I'm a little worried. I think ticket sales will be fine (we're ahead for presales), but the weather is looking terrible for this weekend. I'm praying it blows out and we get warm weather.

More later.
