Man. I'm not sure how today is going to go.

I woke up to a Google Wave invite, but also to a cold room. Jessica had left early for work already and I guess was running late because it was 7min to 7:00 when I heard the front door slam.

Coffee was a disaster this morning. Jess usually makes the coffee because I can't seem to get it right. With her being rushed this morning, she wasn't able to get coffee started before she bolted out the door. So I thought I'd give it a try.

Yeah. Messed it up. She had put water in the maker already, just hadn't ground the beans - but I didn't realise this. I ended up adding a bit of water to the tank before noticing there was some in there already. The coffee came out weak.

We're snobs about coffee. It has to hit our minimal strength scale otherwise we chuck it. I should've just pulled the french press out and made some more, but to be honest, I just now thought of that. Three hours later, sitting at my desk.

I got to work and the outside door was lock. It's the only door I don't have a key to. So I stood out in the rain for a few minutes until someone showed up.

Now I am staring at a long list of work orders and trying to get my dotCMS test server up and running so I can test a few things. And it isn't working. Hopefully the day will improve.
