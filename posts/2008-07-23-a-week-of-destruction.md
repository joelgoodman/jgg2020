So this week (yeah, I know... it's only Wednesday) has been SO long. And also so eventful. Above was one of the first images I saw on Tuesday as I headed up to fourth LaDue to start my time lapse video (which I have yet to watch). Nine or ten truck loads of dirt were brought out for the claw to climb up to Hogue Hall height.

I set up a time lapse camera (GL2... because our new hi-def Panasonic prosumer camera CANNOT DO TIMELAPSE?!?!?!) on the top of LaDue and let it run. I think I have a half hour of time lapse footage. Can't wait to watch it tomorrow.

Pancho and I took photos the whole weekend as well. A lot of destruction. A 150 year old building.

And now they have to clear away the rubble.
