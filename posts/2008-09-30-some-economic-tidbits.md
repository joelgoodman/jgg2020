> *We certainly don't need a system based on the wholly implausible proposition that, in the end, government knows better than people. We should resist at all costs the historically challenged claim that politicians, or the officials they appoint, can possibly know better than free, liquid, well-informed markets in which, every day, hundreds of millions of people put their own money on the line to choose their own future.*

I really like Gerard Baker's viewpoint. First off, he's a Brit in the US. Second, he's got tons of foreign experience. His perpective is often different than everything I see in the media.
This particular piece he's written is intelligent and, I think, pretty accurate.
