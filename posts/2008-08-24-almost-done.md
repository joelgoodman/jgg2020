Tomorrow morning is the morning. I actually feel really confident. I went over a few GRE details earlier today and then took (almost) the rest of the day off, just like Kaplan told me to. But I did review a bunch of math stuff and read the notes on how to do the essay section. It shouldn't be too bad.

So. I feel good.

We went over to V. Ross's house tonight for dessert with the incoming transfer and freshman Communication majors. It was pretty fun actually. I talked to Cary about the program at Syracuse and he was really excited about it. I think V. is glad I'm applying to the program too. And I get more and more excited about it every day. It will be so awesome.

Anyway. I added something to this blog today. Scroll to the bottom and you'll see it.
