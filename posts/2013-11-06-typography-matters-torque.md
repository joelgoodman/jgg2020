Over the past couple of months I've been sporadically contributing to the [Torquemag.io](http://torquemag.io) community with posts on topics related to design. [Yesterday they published an article I wrote](http://torquemag.io/typography-matters/) on basic typography guidelines for web design. When talking to the editor at Torque, trying to come up with my next article topic, we both landed on the realization that a lot of people just aren't designers and don't think in the same creative ways that designers do. And nowhere is that more apparent than in the fonts that they choose.

*Typography Matters* is my shot at giving normal people basic guidelines for how to choose and use typography in their websites, emails, slide presentations... anywhere they need to use text. It's based on a wide range of ideas I've learned over the years and includes a ton of resources for more reading and learning.
