Well, I did it. Jess and I started our novels yesterday. I'm 1847 words on my way to the 50,000 word goal.

My friend [Matt](http://www.pedalboy.net) suggested I should post my writing updates to this blog. I think I might but it's going to be a private affair. Most of what I am writing is going to be garbage. That's the nature of writing a first novel and especially so with the speed and intensity that this marathon calls for. So. I think I've come up with a compromise.

I am not going to list my novel updates publicly for all of Google to find and index. Instead, I'll post them here as private posts, at the moment. I don't want to subject anyone who stops by to that kind of literary grief, so I'm giving you the choice.

If, in your sick and twisted mind, you feel the need to commit mental self-masochism and actually *want* to read the crap that's going coming out of my fingertips (not literal crap), you can register yourself on this blog and I'll find a way to open up those posts to subscribers.

I'm only going to leave registration open for a limited time, so if you want to keep up, register right now. I'm hoping that in exchange for me sharing this embarrassing, terrible, not-fit-for print creative drivel with you, that you will encourage me to keep going and get to my 50,000 word goal. I'm looking at this as school. I want my writing to get better and I'm told this is the best way to do it.

So you decide. Register?
