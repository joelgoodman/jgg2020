Jessica and I stayed home for Thanksgiving. It was our first on our own. And it was nice. I finished the floors in the front room and we cooked food. We decorated for Christmas after dinner (hence the photo above) and watched *Holiday Inn* which was excellent. Fred Astaire was a fantastic dancer. And I've always liked Bing Crosby.

And now, We're watching *The Muppet Christmas Carol* which means Thanksgiving is officially over and the Christmas season is upon us. I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving with friends or family. Tomorrow I am hoping to buy a pound of coffee beans and write 7000 words toward my novel. Or more. And watch every other Christmas movie we own.
