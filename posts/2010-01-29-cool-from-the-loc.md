(LOC)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/4313796984/), originally uploaded by [The Library of Congress](http://www.flickr.com/people/library_of_congress/).

The Library of Congress has the absolute coolest Flickr photostream. They routinely archive old newspapers and photos. I saw this today and it got the history geek in me excited. It's the New York Tribune with an article exploring where the city is going to store the Titanic when it docksâ€¦

So cool.
