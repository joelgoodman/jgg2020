My friend Thom posted a blog entry a couple days ago and then we started talking about 'tics. And you all know how outspoken I am. Anyway, another one of his readers responded. And not too nicely either. But Jessica said I should post my response here. You can read the tip-off and the subsequent comments on Thom's blog [here](http://theelms.typepad.com/thom/2008/10/qualifications-able-to-memorize-passages-excellent-winker.html).

Well, it's obvious that the PC movement has poisoned this debate. I use BHO to represent Barack Obama (whose state I live in, actually) in the same way I use GWB to indicate George W Bush. It's shorthand online.

As for the Limbaugh comment, I haven't listened to Rush since I was a kid in my dad's car. Never once have I chosen to listen to Rush. And in this election I watch CNN and BBC World News America supplemented with NPR news online. I am a registered Independent in Illinois, and am so because contrary to Brad's "feelings" about Obama, I am thinking through the campaign.

The Cheney/Palin comment was a joke, you know, because Thom and I are friends and I feel like I can joke around with him.

Now that I am out of school, have a wife, own and am renovating a house and am trying to improve my family's life, I too am thinking about the future. A future where I will be taxed higher, will be fighting amongst the thousands that will be getting a degree on the taxpayer's dime for a not-so-good paying job, and will be living in a country that quite possibly could be attacked at any moment because of our president's naivet√© if Barack Obama is elected into office.

I am thinking about a world bigger than my little town, bigger than my little life. I'm thinking about history and its tendency to repeat itself. I'm looking at how today's world looks a hell of a lot like the early days of the Cold War, or even the mid-90s when Bill Clinton was running on "change." A man who inherited a great economy on its rise (and a tech boom that helped a lot) but who contributed to financial ruin today.

I can't rationally vote based on "inspiration." I can't rationally vote for the socialisation of this country. Yes, I do lean Neocon. But that is because this is a time to be more conservative and conscious.

What I don't like about "BHO" is his record (in my state! I've been following his career since probably before you knew who he was), his policy, and his fantastical idealism. Because idealism doesn't work. Especially not when the leadership is corrupt.
