So I posted about my wife's new [Etsy store](http://waysideviolet.etsy.com/) a couple days ago. She's already sold something and has been getting a lot of interest, which is so cool! She's working hard on getting a bunch more stuff up on her store. Sales from that is how we buy presents for our friends and family during the year ;)

Anyway. To go along with her new store, I felt she needed a new look for her blog, and a new URI. So I registered [waysideviolet.com](http://waysideviolet.com) and got to work on a new design. Here's a screenshot of where I'm at so far:

Hop over to the Skitch page and let me know what you think. I'll probably put it live on her blog in a couple of days.

I'm still working on Wix's blog, but probably won't have a good working version until next week. Jess and I have a packed weekend -- we're flying out to Spokane Friday evening to meet up with my family for my aunt's 60th birthday. It'll be fun when we're there, but I'm not looking forward to the airports. Then we'll have one weekend at home before we drive out to WV for my father-in-law's 50th. So much going on travel-wise. Thus is life, I suppose.
