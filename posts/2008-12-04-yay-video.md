So, I think VideoBlogs are the coolest thing for certain types of marketing. Yes, videoBlogs (not vlogs - that sounds... gross). That is what I worked on at work today and it was fun. When I was done editing, I was sad because I wanted more. So, it will be ongoing and I'm thinking about finagling some sort of on-campus program for doing video blogging.

Also, Vimeo is awesome. I just wish they did h.264 instead of flash.
