My friend Ryan lives in [Denver](http://www.denverpost.com/politicswestnews/ci_10307300) and he shared this video on his [blog](http://snapshots.ryanlinstrom.com/?p=5).

Did they not think this would fly around the internet? This isn't France. Those people were peaceably assembled. They were invoking their constitutional rights. And they were threatened and bullied and attacked by the people their tax dollars go to pay to protect and serve the public. It's an atrocity.

**Edit**
[Randall](http://randallpauljenkins.com/2008/08/27/protesting-and-holding-signs-on-street-corners/) makes a few good points on his blog as well. As soon as the protestors got in the way of traffic or started blocking streets they went past peaceably assembled. But I'm also sure the police could have handled it a bit than enclosing the crowd between buildings on the left and right and two lines of cops in full
