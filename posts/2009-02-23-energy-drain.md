I haz it.

Man. I don't know what it is--crazy complex work projects, freelance designs and not having a computer to do them on (until a few days ago), waiting for a grad school response, all of the above--but I am seriously down. It's not melancholy, it's not depression... it's just massive fatigue.

I need something fun and carefree for about a week. Maybe I need to go shoot some photos someplace. I think probably I would just really like answers and closure on all of these wide open tasks and inquiries. I want to be accepted to grad school. I want to shoot this documentary that's in my head.

Projects as of right now:

- dotCMS deployment at work
- Site for Andrew Stonestreet
- whatisawix.com
- Site for Greenville Free Methodist Church
- Blog for Stephen Stonestreet
- Site for my dad.
- And I REALLY want to update my blog's design

Plus miscellaneous everyday sort of tasks at work; website updates, keeping people happy, AgapeFest.com updates.Â 

Maybe I just need some sunshine and colour. I think what I really need is a change of pace. And some time to just sit down and create. Some travel would be nice as well. But real travel. Not these stupid 8-hour drives to spend one day someplace remote.

I need some adventure.
