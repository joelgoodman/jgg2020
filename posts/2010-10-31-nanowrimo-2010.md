It's November (well, in a few hours it is) and that means it's time for National Novel Writing Month -- that extra-busy month where tens of thousands of people set out to write a 50,000 word novel in just 30 days. This will be my third year attempting, and hopefully my second year winning.

To be perfectly honest, I lost last year. I gave up. I was teaching my first college-level class at the time and just felt like NaNoWriMo was one more thing on my task list. I'm hoping to be a little bit more diligent this year, especially as I have a lot more going on (full time work, full time grad school, tons of freelance, family coming... yeah).

In any case. NaNoWriMo is a great time and a great group of people. It feels good to be able to say at the end of November that you have finally written a novel in your life. I've written one. I hope to have a second this year (and to actually finish it).
