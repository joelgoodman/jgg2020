So, it appears that Biden - with his party's super-in-touch-with-Americans appeal - doesn't know his own neighborhood.

During Thursday's VP debate, 'ol Joe was [making a point](http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/vice-presidential-debate.html) about how out of touch John McCain is with America:

> BIDEN: Can I respond? Look, all you have to do is go down Union Street with me in Wilmington or *[ed. note: Original transcripts and video have Biden saying "and," not "or"]* go to Katie’s Restaurant or walk into Home Depot with me where I spend a lot of time and you ask anybody in there whether or not the economic and foreign policy of this administration has made them better off in the last eight years. And then ask them whether there’s a single major initiative that John McCain differs with the president on. On taxes, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, on the whole question of how to help education, on the dealing with health care.
> 
> Look, the people in my neighborhood, they get it. They get it.

It seems Joe's shout-outs confused some of his beloved neighbors. From [delawareonline](http://www.delawareonline.com/blogs/secondhelpings/2008/10/joe-gives-delaware-shout-outs.html):
> OK, here's the deal, last night Biden did mention Katie's restaurant and Union Street.
> 
> But I checked The News Journal archives this morning and, well, don't plan on trying to find it on Union Street anytime soon. And I wonder if the Katie's today, which is now actually Wings to Go at Katies, is the same Katie's that Joe remembers.....
> 
> Katie's was at the corner of Sixth and Scott streets in Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood. (Not Union Street.) It had been a local and much-loved institution, well known for its rich, thick Italian gravy (tomato sauce) and spaghetti. It was opened in 1936 by Silvio Spiezio, who later sold it in 1945. The Fugilino family owned and ran the restaurant for years until it was sold in the 1981 after Frances Mae Fugilino's death.
> 
> Katie's then changed hands again in 1985, but new owners kept the venerable name.
> 
> But it eventually changed hands again - at least 10 years ago, maybe even more like 15 years ago (SEE UPDATE BELOW) - and was renamed C.J. Bart's, which according to features reporter Ryan Cormier in a May 2008 News Journal story became " a spot with an unsavory reputation as a magnet for panhandlers and worse."

Joe is always good for a laugh.
