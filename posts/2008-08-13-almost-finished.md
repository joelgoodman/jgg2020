The new theme, which I have dubbed Rock Out Loud for the general WordPress community and "AgapeFest 2009" for the festival, is really really close to being done. And actually, the WP version with widget ready sidebars and that is completely done... except I might give it a once-over and see what can be improved.

I'm really happy with it. I'll make a formal announcement when I release the template/theme into the wild and then you guys can play with what I'm talking about. But I'd love to hear your opinions or criticisms on the design. Leave them in the comments.
