I was just hoping to get the built-in threaded commenting installed and working on this blog (which I did, by the way) and ended making some style revisions. Great. I'm happy with them I think. Bigger titles, bigger, paragraph text, better spacing, stylised forms.

I really should've been working on one of the three or four sites I'm in the middle of for other people. But... well, I'm out of state. It's hard to do that here. And my local MAMP install got botched somehow since last night. And I need to write the last chapter of my novel still (yeah, I procrastinated on that one. I need deadlines).

I'm excited to eat meat or scallops tonight. I haven't decided which yet. But I'm anticipating it. Yum.
