That's right, I have a new big, big-boss. As of this afternoon Greenville College has named a new President, beginning 01 July 2009.

Tonight I'll be heading over to a reception for Dr Linamen and taking some photographs as well as giving him an AgapeFest welcome package (with a couple of All-Access passes).

Fun times ahead, and another weekend of working.  Maybe some photos to follow.
