If you are reading this then my domain name has propagated through whatever DNS you are visiting via. Or in layman's terms: my blog has moved and still works!

For this I am happy. So far I'm already having a better experience with Lunarpages than with godaddy (btw, if you need hosting, use me as a referral for lunarpages!). They're ftp is still super slow, but over all I'd much rather use cPanel to configure everything than godaddy's lame ugly ajaxy backend.

Anyway. If you see anything weird, let me know. But everything should be the same (except I'm using a new [lifestreaming](/lifestream) plugin!)
