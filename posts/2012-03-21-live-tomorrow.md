***Update:*** *The archived version of the show is on Higher Ed Live. [Check it out](http://higheredlive.com/rethinking-social-media-in-higher-ed/).*

I'm live tomorrow afternoon with @sethodell and @bcroke on [Higher Ed Live](http://higheredlive.com). We'll be talking about social media in higher ed and the problems with our approaches. It is shaping up to be a lively discussion that ruffles a few feathers. I myself will be pulling in some of the work I have been doing in my graduate studies and a couple of projects I've instigated in my workplace.

We're hoping to motivate and challenge. Should be an exciting program.

Higher Ed Live starts at 4 pm Eastern on March 22 at [http://higheredlive.com/live](http://higheredlive.com/live)
