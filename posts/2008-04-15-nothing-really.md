I felt the need to blog. But I don't really have anything to say. I'm making some updates and changes here and may add AdSense to the site (just to make a buck). We'll see.

Ummm. [Hypemachine](http://www.hypem.com) is super-cool. I was reminded of this today. But so is the new [Last.fm](http://last.fm) full-track streaming feature. Especially when you're sitting in your office trying to figure out what the top hits of 1998 are and then want to listen to them. With your office mate. And the person in the next office over. It was fun.
