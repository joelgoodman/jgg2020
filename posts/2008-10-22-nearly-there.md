I have pretty much finished moving the [wgrn.net](http://wgrn.net) WP template from Sandbox to stripped-down, cleaned-out, custom code. It feels good.

Now I'm just waiting to be able to http in at work. Seems to work outside of our network but not inside. I think the admins are working on that.

Check the site out later on if you feel like it. I'd like to hear your comments on it. I call the template "Green Modern" and will be releasing it to the WordPress template directory at some point.

*****UPDATE**

It's up. I can't ftp in unless I'm on campus (vpn's been acting up lately), so I've got a couple of things to work on tomorrow. But it's up and you can see it. [Click here](http://wgrn.net).
