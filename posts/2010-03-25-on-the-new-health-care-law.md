I was going to write out a nice post with a summation of the things I don't like about the new bill-become-law, but you know what? Other people have written these thoughts down in better ways than I will, expressing the same concerns and informing new ones that I have. I've written in the past about how I am not a fan of government-run health care. This isn't to say I am against universal health care in general--it's just that I have little faith in central government to dish it out fairly, cost-effectively, and beneficially. Why is that? Look at their track record with other programs.

Dr. John Mark Reynolds wrote a great overview of why he supports universal health care--just not the current health care legislation. He mentions something about Conservatives that I think is worth quoting because around these decision-times there tend to be memes that start floating around that over-generalize the Conservative mindset (note: I mean *actual* Conservativism--not the fiscally irresponsible, arrogant shell of the past decade's Conservative thought). I don't consider myself a full-on Conservative, but I definitely lean toward proven values and responsibility. Here is that piece, and I'd encourage you to read the rest of his reasons.

> Conservatives are not all libertarians. We recognize that some government help may be necessary, but also know that at some point help becomes a hindrance. Health care is not the only good thing in a society. There are also the values of the soul: liberty and happiness. It is the American and Christian idea that too much government can stifle the soul of a man.
