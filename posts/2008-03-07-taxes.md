I just finished my taxes. Decided to e-file. AND Illinois offers an e-file for state now. Taxes were way easier this year than last. Actually being a resident helps I guess. Once the refunds get in we can get our camera!!!

Wow. Boring post. I'm thinking of putting together a rant on global warming fanaticism. Maybe tomorrow. After we demo, drywall and then paint our library room. It's nice to have projects again. Pictures to come, I'm sure.
