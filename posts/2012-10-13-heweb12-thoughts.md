This past Wednesday I returned from Milwaukee, WI and the Higher Education Web Professionals (HighEdWeb or #heweb12) Conference.  This year marked my fourth year of attendance and my first year as a speaker. But more on my presentation later.

I want to reinforce what I say [every](https://blog.joelgoodman.co/heweb11-recap/)[year](https://blog.joelgoodman.co/back-from-heweb10/): the people that work in higher education web marketing and development are the best. I think this year there was a lot of *good* said in the presentations. A lot of challenging words that everyone needed to hear came through. But there were also 11 (eleven!) presentations on going mobile. I mean... yeah, optimizing for mobile users is important, but it's also a topic several years old and I'm not sure that even then it would warrant 11 presentations in a 2-day conference.

There were some extremely practical presentations given, like the one by @mallorywood and @plautmaayan. And then there were some heavily theoretical ones, like @aaronrester's presentation on McLuhan and the tactile web. And then there was the Q&A keynote with Adam Savage (@donttrythis).

I think it's important for this conference to have a good mix of topical information and big idea content. After my first year of attendance at HighEdWeb, I was pretty excited to be a part of this community. There are a ton of brilliant minds (looking at you @pefnam) willing to speak and encourage and help  figure stuff out. It's the most supportive professional community I have ever been a part of. But in 2010, as I was starting my master's degree in Media Studies, I had a cynical outlook on the content. I documented it at the time in my post *[My Take on the State of Higher Education ______](https://blog.joelgoodman.co/state-of-highedweb/)*and got a good discussion going. I think we've gotten better. It took time for the heweb community to settle down and back away from the tools and focus on the goals (a lot of people, including @mallorywood and @ashleyhenn have been pushing this the past couple years at the conference) and outcomes.

But I also feel like there's still a group that isn't quite getting it. Higher Ed, as an industry, is slow to change and learn. I was appreciative of the slant toward topical "ways-to-do-stuff" presentations this year. My own was meant as an encouragement for schools to **Fight to Do Cool Things** while giving practical strategies to pull it off. I'm hoping that as people continue to show up to these conferences, they'll find challenging ideas that progress our industry.

I see it happening. I think the committee did a better job of crafting a diverse lineup of presentations this year – even with the mobile blind spot. And that's encouraging. So, a big "Thank You!" to the #highedweb organizers. I thought it was a great conference. And an even bigger "You guys are awesome!" to my friends and colleagues that were at the conference this year.
