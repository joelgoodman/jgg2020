Also, 90% of my problems are due to user error. Other users. As in the people that aren't smart enough to find the "Order Transcripts" link on the EDU site. Off the top of my head I can give you two paths that require two clicks or less that will get you to the Transcripts ordering page.

1. Click the Quicklinks dropdown on the homepage and find the "Transcripts (Ordering)" option.
2. Click Alumni. Find the Request a Transcript Link on the bottom of the page.

But people want a button because they're sending alums to gettranscriptsnow or something ridiculous like that. A button?! There is a link on the front page already! Under Quicklinks! Which are there to get you to places quickly!

Makes me mad. Now we have to do a URL forward to the transcripts page which is still better than a button. It's just annoying that you can't tell people to following the links from the front page. And that they're too lazy to go find the link for themselves. Especially when we've made it as logical and obvious as possible.

Alumni need transcripts therefore there is a link under the Alumni page. Transcripts are commonly requested, therefore it's under Quicklinks. The Records office handles transcripts, so there is a link on the Records page. THINK ABOUT IT!
