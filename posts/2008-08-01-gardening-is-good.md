We have gotten two (2) pear tomatoes and (2) two Serrano chilies from our garden so far. There are more pear tomatoes on the way and at least one Big Beef.

Photos are forthcoming. Except for ones of the pear tomatoes. Because I ate both of them. And they were tasty!

Also. Our house appraised much higher than what we paid for it. And quite a bit higher than the money we put into it. So... YAY! It's exciting. I'm hoping we can get new windows. At least in the front of the house.
