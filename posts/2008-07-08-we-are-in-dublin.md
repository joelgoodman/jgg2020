Andre and Liz's wedding was great. We met some really awesome people (hi brian, Ryan, and jocelyne!)

Now we're in Dublin. It's our first full day and it's ending. We're going shopping tomorrow and maybe a day tour out someplace on Thursday. Then we're home.

We have to get wifi at a pub so I can't update often! That's all for now. I'll do a big update (with photos) when we're back on Friday
