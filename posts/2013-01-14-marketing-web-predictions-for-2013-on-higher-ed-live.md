Last week I had the privilege to join Seth Odell, Ma'ayan Plaut, and Mike Petroff on the amazing web show, Higher Ed Live. We chatted for an hour about our predictions for 2013 in higher education web marketing. I had a blast talking shop with these incredibly smart people.

If you want some encouragement to do awesome stuff this year and maybe a few ideas, [check out the archived video over on Higher Ed Live](https://higheredlive.com/looking-ahead-marketing-web-predictions-for-2013/).
